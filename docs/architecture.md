# Architecture

## Core model

`projmux` is built around a small set of domain objects:

- `ProjectRoot`: a directory that may map to a tmux session
- `SessionIdentity`: the stable session name derived from a directory
- `SessionTarget`: the current selected session/window/pane target
- `CandidateSet`: the ordered list of project directories presented to the user
- `PinSet`: user-curated candidate priority state
- `PreviewState`: selected window/pane state used by popup and session previews

## Layers

### 1. Core
Pure rules and state transitions.

Responsibilities:
- directory normalization
- session naming
- candidate ordering
- pin state changes
- tagged selection state
- lifecycle decisions such as reuse, create, kill, fallback

This layer should not shell out directly.

### 2. Integrations
Adapters for external systems.

Initial adapters:
- tmux
- filesystem
- git metadata for preview enrichment

Responsibilities:
- execute commands
- parse command output
- convert failures into typed errors

#### Codex app-server compatibility and lifecycle bridge

`internal/integrations/agents/codexappserver` is a Codex-only vertical slice.
It owns the headerless JSON-RPC request, response, and notification wire types,
the newline-delimited direct-stdio framing limit, request IDs,
initialize/initialized handshake, local cancellation, and connection
replacement. The local proxy transport performs the required HTTP Upgrade and
bounded RFC6455 WebSocket framing (including masked client frames) before
carrying those JSON-RPC messages. Core metadata and UI packages receive only
its closed, content-free health result; they do not import app-server request
or event types.

The compatibility probe runs the fixed read-only bridge `codex app-server
proxy` against the local control socket and sends only `initialize` plus
`initialized`. Doctor, Settings, and support-report triggers remain probe-only
and never mutate daemon state. A future native user-action trigger may enter the
lifecycle seam, but only the exact closed `daemon-not-running` classification
(the official local socket is missing or refuses a local connection) may invoke
the installed CLI's idempotent `codex app-server daemon start`, at most once for
the shared in-flight attempt in this process. The start and readiness retry are
bounded, each caller can cancel its own wait, and readiness must still complete
the proxy initialize handshake. All other executable, timeout, unsupported,
protocol, and endpoint failures stay on the existing fallback without a start
attempt.

The bridge discards command output and reports only closed, content-free health
and lifecycle reasons; prompts, tokens, paths, and process output do not cross
the integration boundary. It does not install, bootstrap, restart, or stop the
daemon, change Codex configuration, perform login, manage a custom socket, or
accept remote WebSocket control. Projmux shutdown does not stop the shared
daemon. No existing Agent create/resume, hook, review, catalog, model, or usage
consumer uses the native source in this phase. Settings displays the decision
as a read-only state row; it is not a user-selectable authority.

### 3. UI orchestration
Picker data is modeled independently from row rendering. The app builds
backend-neutral `picker.Item` values (`Title`, `Value`, `SearchText`,
`MetaLines`, `Badges`, `PreviewTarget`) and renders them through the native
picker.

Responsibilities:
- rows for popup and sidebar views
- preview rendering
- keybind-to-action dispatch
- selection handoff into core actions
- picker-agnostic close/dismiss actions

Picker-specific display, search, input, and popup rules are tracked in
[native-picker.md](native-picker.md).

This keeps parity with the existing shell workflow while moving state and behavior into Go.

### 4. Local environment
This repo owns the portable application behavior and generated tmux config.

Responsibilities that remain outside `projmux`:
- terminal emulator key dispatch
- shell startup policy
- install-time package checks
- machine-specific path and symlink choices

## Configuration model

Config should be explicit and file-backed.

Candidate areas:
- managed roots (scan roots for candidate discovery; never managed identity)
- default home-like roots
- preview preferences
- session naming exceptions
- ephemeral session retention defaults

## State model

Persistent state:
- pins (typed: managed Project uid, or unregistered candidate path)
- lightweight user preferences

Ephemeral runtime state:
- preview selection
- popup marker files
- current tagged selection set

## Resource attribution model

The Linux resource-attribution core is an ephemeral, read-only projection. A
tmux-specific typed inventory supplies socket/session/window/pane identities,
pane PID/TTY, and the stable session `@projmux_project_path` anchor. A one-pass
procfs collector supplies PID+starttime identity, SID, CPU ticks, RSS, and host
capacity. Pure aggregation builds pane, unique-window, and project rows without
using labels, topics, titles, or cwd-derived names as ownership keys.

Resource snapshots are not Session State and are never saved or restored. See
[resource-attribution.md](resource-attribution.md) for metric, partial-state,
host-remainder, privacy, and measurement contracts.

## Resource metadata model

`projmux` owns a persistent resource model that is independent of tmux
lifecycle. It is the storage, ownership, and name-allocation foundation for the
CLI information architecture v2 resource routes.

Packages:

- `internal/core/metadata` is pure: the resource model, validation, name
  allocation, schema migration, snapshot reconciliation, and the operation
  transaction. It performs no I/O; the clock, uid source, and root-directory
  probe are injected through `Mutator`.
- `internal/core/resourcegraph` is pure: the resolved resource graph that joins
  the Registry's desired topology to one exact tmux server, the typed
  session/window/pane inventory it is resolved against, the closed attribution
  and status vocabularies, and the transport descriptor. It performs no I/O.
- `internal/core/runtimediag` is pure: the read-only projection of one resolved
  graph's runtime half -- every observed tmux object with its attribution, its
  exact coordinate, and the Registry resource it is bound to, plus the scopes
  that could not be observed. It performs no I/O and re-derives no attribution.
- `internal/core/registryview` is pure: the primary navigation view model. It
  projects a resolved graph plus the caller's filesystem discovery onto the rows
  the Projects, Sessions, and Recent Windows surfaces list -- Registry resources
  in Registry order, discovered directories in their own section, and one Runtime
  link -- with a status overlay and the actions each resource state is eligible
  for. It performs no I/O.
- `internal/core/controller` is pure: the command-scoped controller kernel. It
  owns the closed intent x attribution authority table, the guard evidence, and
  the totally ordered plan every convergence producer is authorized through. It
  performs no I/O and holds no tmux dependency; the guard field spellings are
  supplied by the caller.
- `internal/integrations/metadata` owns the registry file (lock, atomic write,
  migration), the tmux transport mirror, and the bounded observation adapter that
  fills a `resourcegraph.Inventory` from one exact server.
- `internal/integrations/tmuxopts` is a dependency-free leaf holding the
  canonical spelling of every projmux-owned tmux option name, so the generated
  tmux config, session-state replay, and the resource mirror cannot drift.

Resources and ownership:

- Kinds are `Project`, `Window`, `Pane`, `Agent`, and `ControlSession`, stamped
  with `apiVersion: projmux.io/v1alpha1`.
- `ownerRef` runs (Project | ControlSession) → Window → (shell Pane | Agent),
  and an Agent owns its current managed Pane. A Window's allowed owner set is
  exactly those two root kinds; every other ownerRef kind is refused.
- A `ControlSession` is the app-owned control session -- the Home session
  `projmux shell` opens -- as a Registry root. It exists so Home's Windows and
  Panes have an owner chain at all: before it, pane `%0` of Home carried no
  `@projmux_window_uid`, so every route that resolves "the active target"
  refused there.
- **A ControlSession owns no filesystem path, and `ControlSessionSpec` has no
  field that could hold one.** `spec.session` names the exact tmux session and
  nothing else. That is the structural guarantee behind "$HOME is never a
  Project": managed roots, trust, rebind, cwd defaults, and `ProjectByRoot` all
  read `Project.spec.root`, so a control session cannot leak into any of them
  even by accident. `$HOME` is never registered as a Project and never added to
  managed roots.
- A ControlSession is recognized as one only on evidence, never by name: the
  server must carry `@projmux_app=1` and the exact session's
  `@projmux_session_role` must be exactly `control`. `@projmux_ephemeral=1`
  together with a control role fails closed on both sides -- the reader refuses
  the pair and the writer refuses to produce it.
- Control identity is one declarative controller plan, not an install-time
  migration. The canonical shell lifecycle declares one exact socket/session;
  `config apply` declares the canonical Home target on the exact `-L` server it
  just reloaded; and later lifecycle triggers may continue only an exact
  ControlSession identity already stored in the Registry. For those inputs the
  root, control role, and every Window/Pane uid owner-chain mirror converge from
  any partial state, and a second pass performs no Registry or tmux write.
  Foreign or duplicate claimants and any Project uid claim refuse the whole
  plan before its first write. Session-name resemblance, cwd, commands,
  display names, and the app marker by itself are never promotion evidence.
- ControlSession names share the registry-wide scope with Project names but not
  a reservation slot, because `nameReservations` is keyed by kind as well as
  scope. A Project named `home` and a ControlSession named `home` coexist.
- A persistent tmux **Session is not a resource**. It is a 1:1 runtime
  projection of a Project recorded in `Project.status.session` with a `live`
  flag, and it owns no uid, name, or ownerRef. Auto-attach ephemeral sessions
  live only in runtime inventory, outside the Project hierarchy. A
  ControlSession is not a counter-example: it is a root resource that *names* a
  session, and the session still carries no identity of its own.
- `Window` and `Pane` carry **no stored liveness field**, deliberately. Their
  `status` block holds observed conditions only; live/offline is derived from a
  live tmux observation at read time. See *Runtime observation and resource
  status* below.
- Every non-empty Project stores one exact canonical Window and every Window
  stores a role-independent Pane anchor. `Project.spec.primaryWindowRef`
  resolves to a Project-owned Window whenever the Project owns any Windows;
  it is empty only for the valid closed zero-Window state. Final schema v2 requires
  `Window.spec.anchorPaneRef`; it may resolve through the same Window ancestry
  to either a direct `role=shell` Pane or an Agent-owned `role=agent` Pane.
  `Window.spec.defaultShellPaneRef` is optional; when present it resolves only
  to a directly Window-owned `role=shell` Pane. Project registration creates
  both refs on the same initial shell **offline**, with no tmux involvement,
  so Project and Window metadata stays queryable while tmux is down.
  Phase-2 consumers resolve `anchorPaneRef` as the stable role-agnostic split
  target. An explicit Pane selector or popup origin wins over that stored ref;
  the stored anchor is consulted only when the invocation scopes no Pane.
  Shell-required offline creation may adopt or lazily allocate the optional
  default shell without replacing an Agent anchor. Consumers never write the
  removed intermediate `primaryPaneRef` field.
  Canonical deletion preserves the same invariant: deleting the primary Window
  reanchors to the first existing valid sibling, while deleting the last Window
  leaves the existing Project with an empty `primaryWindowRef`, a non-live
  session observation, and no replacement allocation. The requested Window and
  all descendants are removed exactly; only explicit Project deletion removes
  the owning root itself.

Home and root kinds:

This is the one place that answers "what is Home". The word names three
different things and they are not interchangeable.

- **The Home tmux session is a `ControlSession` root, and it is not a Project.**
  `projmux shell` opens it, the convergence pass marks it
  `@projmux_session_role=control` on an `@projmux_app=1` server, and
  `BindControlSession` records it as a Registry root that owns Windows and
  Panes. It has **no path**: `ControlSessionSpec` holds `spec.session`, the
  exact tmux session name, and has no field that could hold a root. `$HOME` is
  therefore never a Project root, never a managed root, never a rebind target,
  and never returned by `ProjectByRoot`, and no route registers it as one.
- **`$HOME` the directory is a discovery candidate like any other.** If
  filesystem discovery offers it, it is an unregistered bootstrap candidate. It
  becomes a Project only if an operator explicitly opens it, and doing so
  creates an ordinary Project that has nothing to do with the ControlSession.
- **The sidebar Home chrome row is neither of the above.** It is a synthesized
  navigation row for the operator's own root: it carries no uid, no
  `resourceRef`, and no managed identity, it is not a reconcile or create
  target, and it disappears entirely when discovery does not offer `$HOME`. It
  leads the Projects list because it is where the surface starts from, not
  because it is a member of what the surface orders. Home's *Windows and Panes*,
  by contrast, are managed rows -- they are owned by the ControlSession root --
  while the Home session row itself stays classified `control` with no
  `resourceRef`. See *Registry-first primary navigation* below for the row-level detail.

The root kinds may retain the same preferred tmux session name in stored state,
but that does not make the name an identity edge. An exact
`ControlSession.spec.session` claim wins before any Project session-name
fallback. If an explicitly opened Project would otherwise project onto that
physical session, its stable runtime name is `<preferred>--<full Project uid>`;
the Registry Project uid, root, and owner chain remain unchanged. A Project
uid/root observed on the exact control-owned session is D4 contamination, not
permission to adopt or rewrite the control-owned descendants. Observation
failures are quarantined as reason-bearing D6 items so an unrelated session can
still reconcile; only exact socket evidence authorizes runtime writes.

The consequence for every consumer is one rule: **the Registry has two root
kinds and a projection that walks roots has to walk both.** A traversal that
reads `registry.Projects` as if it were the whole root set will drop, refuse,
or fail to report whatever a ControlSession owns. Kind-scoped reads are still
fine and are the common case -- a Project root path, a Project session claim, a
Project pin -- but they are scoped on purpose, not by omission. The classified
list of every root traversal in the tree, and which of the two kinds each one
handles, is maintained as an executable table in
`internal/app/resource_reconcile_root_kind_test.go`; it is re-derived from the
source on every test run, so a traversal added or moved fails until it is
classified.

Divergence taxonomy:

Reconciliation uses one closed, additive classification for every plan and
refusal item. The item's human-readable `reason` remains separate from its
machine-readable `divergence` label: `D1-unrealized` is declared Registry state
with no realization, `D2-unattributed` is observed state with no exact resource
attribution, `D3-orphan-mirror` is a runtime mirror whose uid is absent from the
Registry, `D4-contamination` is a conflicting Registry identity or contradictory
exact evidence, `D5-drift` is a bound resource whose declared and observed
fields differ, and `D6-unknown` is the fail-closed remainder. This taxonomy does
not replace the resolver's managed/control/ephemeral/recoverable/unattributed/
foreign/conflict runtime classes or the reconciler's missing/stale/foreign drift
vocabulary. Doctor and dry-run reports expose counts for all six labels;
support reports expose those counts but redact item reasons and identifiers.

Identity and naming:

- `metadata.uid` is opaque, immutable, and independent of tmux lifecycle. It
  survives snapshot/restore, runtime creation, and root rebind.
- `metadata.name` is the stable unique-within-scope query key. Project names
  and ControlSession names are unique within their own root kind across the
  registry. Window, Pane, and Agent names are unique by
  `(rootOwnerUID, kind, name)`, where the root is the Project or ControlSession
  reached through the direct `ownerRef` chain. Different roots and different
  kinds may use the same spelling.
- Automatic creation mints the opaque UID first and stores that exact full UID,
  including its kind prefix and complete payload, as `metadata.name`. If that
  name slot is already occupied, the unpublished UID is discarded and reminted
  up to 100 times. There is no semantic stem, prefix truncation, sibling scan,
  or numeric suffix allocator. An explicit `--name` keeps its original spelling
  after validation; explicit create and rename collisions fail with exit code 2
  and zero Registry, tmux, or provider writes.
- `create agent` supplies an **explicit** name for the Pane its Agent owns:
  `<agent-name>-pane`, derived from the Agent's own name. That used to be a
  documented follow-up `rename pane` a launcher had to remember, so a caller
  that did not know the convention left the managed Pane addressed by a raw
  UID. It is not a new automatic-name rule -- it goes through the same explicit
  name path an operator's `--name` does, so a Pane with no Agent still gets its
  exact full UID. Length is the only fallback: an Agent name may be the full 128
  bytes, and `<agent-name>-pane` would then be 133 and invalid, so the Pane
  falls back to automatic naming rather than refusing a create that works today.
  A *collision* on the derived name never falls back; it is the same typed exit
  2 with zero writes an explicit `--name` collision produces, because the whole
  metadata phase runs before the first tmux or provider call.
- The derivation runs once, at create, and is deliberately not an invariant.
  `rename agent` does not follow the Pane and `rename pane` is neither forbidden
  nor restricted, so the Pane name keeps exactly one owner and `rename agent`
  keeps its `cardinality=exact-one` effect tuple. A launcher that still issues
  the old follow-up `rename pane <agent-name>-pane` gets a successful no-op,
  because a reservation slot the same uid already holds is not a conflict.
- Schema v4 stores no `metadata.displayName`, `status.displayTitle`, or renamed
  presentation replacement. Human context is projected for one invocation from
  the Project root, topic/provider/command, and exact live tmux title. That
  context may duplicate and is never a selector, reservation, ownerRef, or
  durable identity input. `metadata.labels` remains key/value classification;
  `metadata.annotations` remains non-identifying metadata such as an AI topic.

Root lifecycle:

- `spec.root` is an absolute path. Rebind changes only `spec.root`, atomically,
  never moves files, and never changes the uid. Rebinding onto a root already
  bound to another Project fails with exit code 2 and zero mutations.
- uids are never merged heuristically. Basename, git origin, inode, and scan
  order are not consulted; only an exact saved root that reappears reuses its
  uid.
- A disappeared root records a `MissingRoot` condition with its first-observed
  timestamp and preserves both the metadata and the name reservations. A
  returning root recovers the same uid and clears the condition.

Agent lifecycle:

- The phase set is exactly `Pending`, `Running`, `Offline`, `Failed`. An
  abnormal exit resolves to `Failed`, while killed or unexplained disappearance
  resolves to `Offline` and retains the Agent/Pane rows for diagnosis and
  explicit recovery. A same-generation supervisor exit 0 paired with exact
  `pane-exited` evidence is different: a non-last Pane is removed while its
  Agent is retained Offline. For a last Pane, the complete Window subtree stays
  pending until the exact causal `window-unlinked` half arrives.
- `Offline` for an unexplained disappearance rather than `Failed` is a deliberate
  asymmetry. The phase is what an operator reads to decide whether to resume, and
  an unproven `Failed` is worse for that decision than an honest `Offline`; the
  fact that the answer is unproven is carried by `status.lastTermination`, where
  it can be read without being mistaken for a diagnosis.

Termination evidence transport:

- A managed Pane's `status.activation` names one **materialization** of that
  Pane, not the Pane. It carries an opaque `generation` minted per launch,
  resume, and topology materialization, the exact `%N` handle it landed on, the
  owning Agent uid for an Agent-managed Pane, and the operation id that issued
  it. The uid survives kill/recreate and resume; the generation does not, and
  that is what lets a receipt from a replaced process be recognized as stale
  instead of applied to the Pane that now holds the uid.
- Every managed launch execs `projmux internal supervise --pane-uid <uid>
  --generation <gen> [--agent-uid <uid>] -- <command>...`. The supervisor gives
  the child this pane's exact stdin/stdout/stderr -- the pty tmux allocated, not
  a pipe -- puts it in its own process group, and makes that group the
  terminal's foreground group, so job control works and
  `#{pane_current_command}` keeps naming the child. argv, cwd, and the
  inherited environment are untouched except for two private `PMX_INTERNAL_*`
  capability values carrying this Pane uid and activation generation to the
  provider's own hook children. They are not public `PROJMUX_*` hook API and
  are accepted only together with the Registry binding and exact recorded `%N`
  runtime handle. tmux-side signals aimed at the pane process are relayed to
  the child's group, because the pane pid and the child pid used to be the same
  process. The foreground handoff is attempted and retried without
  it rather than probed for: there is no portable way to ask "is fd 0 my
  controlling terminal" without an ioctl, and a start that fails forks no
  surviving child.
- A managed shell Pane -- one created with no command of its own -- is
  supervised over the process tmux itself would have started: `default-command`
  run by `default-shell` when it is set, and a **login** shell (argv[0] prefixed
  with `-`) when it is empty. Both values are read from the same exact server
  the pane is created on.
- `status.lastTermination` on the Pane, mirrored onto the owning Agent, is the
  minimal durable receipt: closed `source` and `classification` vocabularies,
  `observedAt`, the Pane uid, the optional Agent uid, the generation, and either
  an exit code or a signal name, plus the operation id. It carries no command
  text, no pane content, and no provider conversation data. Like
  `status.sessionRef` it is an optional pointer with `omitempty` and additive
  inside `schemaVersion: 1`.
- The classification vocabulary is four **kinds of proof**, not a severity
  ladder. `intentional` is a canonical control action's own written record and
  may only come from `source: control-action`. `normal` and `abnormal` mean a
  supervisor actually reaped the child: exit 0 and everything else,
  respectively. `unknown` is an explicitly evidence-free record. **Exit 0 is
  never promoted to intent**: a provider that exits because the operator quit
  and one that exits because it finished a batch produce byte-identical wait
  statuses.
- Receipts are applied under a generation guard: the Pane must still exist, the
  receipt's generation must be the Pane's current one, a receipt naming an Agent
  must name the Agent that owns the Pane and still binds it, a receipt the
  registry already stores verbatim is a no-op, and recorded intent is sticky for
  its generation. The last rule is load bearing -- a canonical delete records
  intent and then kills the pane, and the supervisor watching it reports the
  resulting signal; letting the observation win would turn every deliberate
  deletion into a crash report.
- Canonical `delete window|pane|agent` commits its intentional receipt in **its
  own transaction, before the first live mutation**. A failure to make that
  evidence durable aborts with zero tmux mutations. Every refusal after it
  withdraws the receipt again, scoped by the operation id so it can only remove
  what it wrote; a partial delete that really did kill something keeps the
  evidence that explains it.
- Exit reconciliation is what consumes a receipt; see below.
- The lock-free `termination-receipts.jsonl` row precedes a clean process exit
  and therefore outlives a qualifying Pane/Agent Registry deletion. That bounded
  receipt is the post-delete diagnostic: source, classification, observed time,
  Pane/Agent uid, generation, and wait status only. No command, pane content,
  prompt, transcript, or provider payload is recorded.
- The supervisor resolves its state paths from the pane's own inherited
  environment, which is the tmux **server's** environment rather than the
  environment of the CLI call that created the pane. That is the correct
  production binding -- the server is started from the operator's session -- and
  it is why an isolated test has to start its server with the same state root it
  reads the receipts back from.
- Losing a receipt is a supported outcome, not a failure mode. A supervisor
  killed with `SIGKILL`, a lost tmux server, an unwritable registry, and a pane
  whose supervisor could not be constructed all leave no receipt, and the pane
  behaves exactly as it did before supervision existed. An absent receipt is the
  input that resolves to `unknown`; it is never read as a normal exit.
- A managed process that dies before the create transaction that launched it
  commits is a real edge exit reconciliation owns: the reconciliation runs inside
  the next mutation's transaction and can retire the Pane before the supervisor's
  receipt arrives. The receipt is then refused as stale, which is the correct
  outcome -- the Pane it describes is gone -- and the Agent converges on
  `Offline` with `unknown` evidence rather than on invented evidence.
- A Pane **adopted** from a runtime object created for another reason -- the
  first pane a `new-session` brings with it -- carries no generation until it is
  relaunched. Adoption is not supervision: the process was already running, so
  there is nothing to have launched it with.

Exit reconciliation and lifecycle projection:

- A **lifecycle dirty event** is one exact-host statement that a managed runtime
  object's lifecycle may have changed. `pane-exited` carries tmux's exact
  `#{hook_pane}`. Its current-context session/window formats may already name a
  survivor, so the owner `$N/@N` comes from the Window's last live Registry
  observation; `window-unlinked` carries exact `#{hook_session}` and
  `#{hook_window}` for the dead Window. `after-kill-pane` carries neither because
  tmux leaves `#{hook_pane}` empty there. Whole-host and coalesced events remain
  advisory projection inputs and never acquire delete authority.
- The event is advisory. The reconciliation re-observes the **final** snapshot of
  that same exact host and re-reads the registry, so a stale event, a duplicate
  event, and an event for a pane that has since come back all converge on the
  same state as no event at all.
- The observation is the same mirrored-uid read (`list-panes -a -F
  '#{@projmux_pane_uid}...'`) the reconciler and the active-target fallback
  already share, routed through the event's exact target: an explicit `-L/-S`
  addresses that server only, and a zero target routes through the inherited
  client, which is the absolute socket in `$TMUX`. There is no default-socket
  fallback -- a reconciliation that summed two servers could never report a death
  at all, and a sibling server carrying the same `%N` handles or the same
  mirrored uid receives zero calls.
- Releasing the binding has exactly one exception: a managed Pane its own Window
  anchors. `status.paneRef` is what makes an Agent-role `anchorPaneRef` valid, so
  clearing it there would leave the Window anchored on a Pane no Agent claims and
  the Registry would stop validating -- which, because validation runs on the
  proposed state of every transaction, refuses the *next* write of any kind for a
  reason that has nothing to do with it. The binding is kept, the phase alone
  reports that nothing runs in it, and the result is the offline Agent-anchored
  Window snapshot restore already projects and the materializer already replays.
  The bound half of both the dirty check and the projection reads an Agent that
  already carries the stored evidence as finished, so a repeat pass stays
  write-free.
- The retained-state transition is derived from the receipt the Pane already
  stores. `abnormal` lands the Agent in `Failed`; `killed` and an evidence-free
  disappearance land it in `Offline`. A `normal` receipt alone is still only
  evidence. It becomes Pane/Agent delete authority only when the same controller
  pass also has the exact hook Pane and Window, a non-empty exact-socket
  inventory, and a current generation/owner chain.
- An absence with no receipt **records** an `unknown` one, with
  `source: reconcile`. That is what makes the reconciliation idempotent: a second
  pass finds the same document already stored, recording it is a no-op, and the
  registry is left byte-identical. An absence with no stored value would be
  re-projected on every pane exit in every session, forever.
- `source: reconcile` and `classification: unknown` may only appear together.
  Unknown is a statement that nothing was observed, and letting a supervisor that
  read a wait status or a control action that stated its intent file one would let
  either of them erase evidence with it.
- A qualifying exact clean non-last exit removes only the Pane and leaves its
  Agent Offline in the same locked Registry transaction. The owning Window,
  Project/ControlSession, sibling Panes and sibling Agents are unchanged. A
  shell and a provider are intentionally indistinguishable here: both are
  supervised wait-status 0; no command or `/exit` text participates.
- Abnormal, killed, unknown, whole-host absence, missing/empty server inventory,
  permission failure, foreign Window observation, stale generation, and an
  Agent that now binds a resumed Pane all produce delete-plan zero. They keep the
  retained lifecycle projection and canonical explicit Offline delete recovery.
- The closed Agent transition table stays the authority. An Agent that may not
  reach the implied phase keeps its phase, its `paneRef`, and its managed Pane;
  only the evidence is recorded. A refused transition is not a reason to discard
  what was observed.
- Cost is measured in transactions. The projection set is computed against a
  read-only snapshot and the write lock is taken only when something is
  outstanding -- unrecorded evidence, or an Agent still bound to a dead Pane that
  can still move -- so a reconciled disappearance costs zero transactions on every
  later pass. Inside the lock the host is re-observed and the set recomputed,
  because the registry may have gained a freshly created Agent while the event
  waited, and applying the pre-lock observation to that newer registry would
  release the new Agent and delete its still-live Pane.
- It fails closed. An observation that could not be taken is indistinguishable
  from one that found nothing, and reading it as empty would file an `unknown`
  termination against every managed Pane on a machine whose tmux server simply is
  not up. It is also not an error: the reconciliation rides along inside other
  operations and must never fail them.
- Ordering: a supervisor writes its receipt before its own process exits, so the
  journal evidence is durable before tmux tears the pane down. The controller
  absorbs it, re-resolves the exact `%N`/`@N` owner on the event socket, and then
  repeats both inventory and owner/generation checks under the Registry lock.
  Duplicate and permuted receipt delivery is idempotent. A late old-generation
  receipt or a resume that wins the lock cannot follow the new binding.
- The reconciliation performs no runtime call beyond that one observation. It
  never resumes an Agent, starts an offline resource, materializes a replacement
  Pane, deletes an unmanaged object, or adopts one. An observation is not an
  activation authority.
- `get pane|agent` renders the stored receipt in a `TERMINATION` column --
  `<classification>/<source>` with the exit status when one was read, plus a
  relative age -- and `describe pane|agent` renders the classification, source,
  observed instant, exit code or signal, Pane ref, generation, and operation id as
  their own rows. The Registry-first navigation carries the same receipt on its
  Pane and Agent rows. All three are pure projections: a read verb never consumes
  a receipt, advances a phase, or writes to the registry.

Agent provider session ref:

- `status.sessionRef` is the durable pointer from an Agent to the provider
  conversation it belongs to. It is in **status, not spec**, because nothing
  declares it: a provider hook reports it after the fact, exactly like
  `status.paneRef`.
- The two status refs have deliberately different lifetimes. `status.paneRef` is
  the *current* managed-Pane binding and is cleared by `ReleaseAgentPane`,
  `DeletePane`, and every non-`Running` transition except one over a Pane its
  Window anchors. `status.sessionRef` is
  cleared by none of them: an `Offline` Agent that has lost its Pane still knows
  which conversation it is.
- It is **not** a duplicate of the tmux pane option `@projmux_ai_session_id`,
  and that option is not going away. The pane option is the *live routing
  index*: hook ingest scans the live pane list and matches on it to decide which
  pane an incoming event belongs to, so following pane lifetime is correct for
  it. `status.sessionRef` answers "which conversation is this Agent" and must
  outlive the Pane. Ingest writes both.
- The shape is a **per-provider discriminated union**, not one flat string:
  `provider` is the discriminator and exactly one of `claude`, `codex`, or
  `antigravity` is populated. Providers disagree on what identifies a
  conversation — Claude reports a session id plus a transcript path, Codex a
  thread id and a session id, Antigravity a single conversation id — and
  flattening them would assert a false equivalence between a Codex thread id and
  a Claude session id.
- Codex's turn id is deliberately **not** stored. A turn addresses one turn
  inside the conversation and changes on every hook event, so it is not a
  pointer to the conversation.
- Transcript **paths** are recorded as the hook reported them. Nothing reads
  provider config files or transcript **contents**; that is permanently out of
  scope.
- The field is additive inside `schemaVersion: 1`. It is an optional pointer
  with `omitempty`, so a registry written before it existed decodes with a nil
  ref, validates, and re-encodes byte-identically. Bumping the envelope would
  make every already-installed build refuse the file fail-closed with
  `ErrSchemaTooNew`, which is a hard downgrade break bought for nothing.
- **"One conversation ↔ at most one live Agent" is deliberately NOT enforced.**
  Two Agents may carry the same conversation, and `get agents` / `describe agent`
  will show both. Enforcing it would mean a best-effort hook observation could be
  *refused*, making the registry describe a world that does not exist: the same
  conversation really can be attached twice (a manual resume of the same session
  id in a second pane already does that), and an `Offline` Agent keeps its ref
  forever, so a later Agent observing the same conversation would be permanently
  unable to record it. Choosing between several Agents that point at one
  conversation is a resume-time decision and belongs to the resume
  materialization Phase, not to an observation write.
- The write is narrow and idempotent: it touches `status.sessionRef` and nothing
  else — not the phase, not `lastTransitionAt`, not `paneRef` — and
  re-observing the same conversation opens no registry transaction at all. A
  hook whose provider contradicts the Agent's `spec.provider` is refused with
  zero mutations.

Agent launch argv (workspace / task boundary):

- One Agent launch hands the provider CLI two independent things in a single
  argv: the **workspace** (`--cwd` and every `--add-dir` the create validated)
  and the **initial task payload** given after `--`. Where the workspace stops
  is a property of the provider's own parser, so the boundary is provider
  grammar data in `internal/app/agent_launch_argv.go`, not a concatenation at
  the call site. `create agent` and `agent resume` read that one grammar, so a
  provider's option arity cannot be spelled two ways.
- Claude's `--add-dir <directories...>` is **variadic**: it consumes every
  following operand until an option-looking token or `--` stops it. So every
  root travels in one occurrence and the payload is introduced by `--`. A
  payload appended straight after the roots is parsed as one more directory, and
  the session then starts with no task at all — an installed regression that is
  invisible in the argv and surfaces only as an unacknowledged activation.
- Codex's `-C <DIR>` and `--add-dir <DIR>` each take exactly one value, so roots
  repeat the option and no payload can be absorbed. Codex's argv is deliberately
  left byte-identical, which is also why a Codex prompt beginning with `-` is
  still read in option position, exactly as before.
- projmux gives additional roots only to Codex and Claude. A stored root for any
  other provider is refused at launch construction rather than translated into a
  flag this seam never validated, so an Agent never starts with access narrower
  than what it records.
- An empty payload contributes nothing, so the interactive create and the resume
  argv (where the provider's own conversation option, not a terminator, ends the
  variadic root option) are unchanged.

Agent resume:

- `agent resume <ref>` rebinds an existing Agent: it builds the provider's
  **resume** argv from `status.sessionRef`, resolves the target Window's
  exact role-agnostic `anchorPaneRef`, splits a new managed Pane detached, and
  attaches it to that Agent. The
  `metadata.uid` and `metadata.name` do not change, `status.phase` becomes
  `Running`, and `status.paneRef` points at the new Pane. `status.sessionRef`
  itself is read and never rewritten by resume.
- **A resume that cannot happen fails; it never becomes a create.** `create agent`
  always mints a new uid and `agent resume` always reuses one, and the two are
  not one code path: the resume route holds a launch seam whose only argv builder
  takes a conversation id, so there is no fresh-start argv it can produce. Every
  refusal below is decided against a read-only registry snapshot, so it opens
  zero registry transactions and issues zero `split-window` calls.
- The refusals are: a `Running` Agent (usage error naming `focus pane`); any
  phase other than `Offline`/`Failed`; **an Agent with no `sessionRef` at all**,
  which is the normal state of an Agent whose provider hook never ran and which
  names `create agent` rather than performing it; a ref whose conversation id the
  provider's own resume builder rejects; a ref contradicting a declared
  `spec.provider`; a provider disabled in Settings; a provider binary that is not
  installed; a `MissingRoot` Project; and a Window with no resolvable anchor Pane.
- **Several Agents may point at one conversation, and the conversation is never a
  selector.** Resume rebinds exactly the Agent the reference resolves to and
  never searches the registry by conversation id to choose a different one, so
  duplicates neither redirect nor block a rebind — refusing them would make the
  state the observation write deliberately allows permanently unusable. The
  duplicates are disclosed on stderr in uid order, which makes the disclosure
  byte-identical regardless of registry order.
- **`observedAt` is not a resume gate.** It records when projmux last *saw* the
  conversation, not a provider timestamp, so it cannot answer "is this ref
  stale": a conversation untouched for a month is perfectly resumable and one
  observed a minute ago may already be deleted. The only authority is the
  provider, and reading its store is permanently out of scope, so projmux checks
  what it can see and hands the rest to the provider's resume argv.
- Resume is **conversation-granularity for every provider**. Codex's turn id is
  not stored and `codex resume <thread-id>` has no turn slot, so turn-level
  resume is not something this surface can express today.

Registry file and schema:

- The registry lives at `<state>/projmux/metadata/registry.json` (0600 below a
  0700 directory). Ordinary mutations use an `O_CREATE|O_EXCL` lock file with
  bounded retry and stale-lock breaking, matching the notify queue and
  recent-windows stores. Explicit Registry repair uses its own recovery lock;
  see the recovery boundary below.
- The envelope carries `schemaVersion: 4`. Version 1 is the first Registry
  envelope projmux wrote; this build migrates v1 through v2 and v3 before the
  v3 → v4 root-scoped naming and presentation-field cutover.
- Everything else fails closed: the file is refused as unreadable and **no
  write happens at all** — no rewrite, no backup, no staged temp file. This
  covers a **newer** schemaVersion (which would destroy state a newer build
  owns), malformed JSON, and a document that parses but carries **no**
  `schemaVersion`. An absent field decodes as version `0`, which means unknown
  rather than pre-release: migrating it would rewrite a corrupt or foreign file
  at the registry path, which is exactly the write-on-unknown-input that
  fail-closed exists to prevent. The registry is deliberately not quarantined
  or reset the way a corrupt recent-windows file is.
- A file that is absent, empty, or whitespace-only is the legitimate "no
  registry yet" case **only before the first successful write**; see the durable
  envelope below. Only a file with actual content and no usable `schemaVersion`
  is refused as unknown.
- A normal locked `Load` of v1, v2, or v3 runs the production migration chain,
  validates the repaired graph, writes the versioned backup, and publishes the
  v4 bytes through the existing temp-file atomic replace. A failed migration
  leaves the source bytes unchanged. Every successful first migrator (`Load`,
  `Update`, `UpdateConvergent`, or explicit `Migrate`) also atomically publishes
  a 0600 `<exact-backup>.migration-report.json` beside the versioned backup
  before the Registry replace. That durable evidence records the exact absolute backup
  path, SHA-256 of its byte-identical source contents, version pair, repair/loss
  counts, and every repair detail. It is outside rolling recovery retention.
  A failed migration removes any staged/published report before returning while
  leaving the source bytes unchanged. `LoadWithMigrationResult` and `Migrate`
  additionally return both exact paths from the same locked transaction. A
  second pass sees v4 and writes neither Registry, backup, nor report bytes. An
  existing invalid v4 document is validated and refused byte-identically even
  when explicit `Migrate` has no version step to run.
  Explicit read-only inspection migrates only its returned in-memory view and
  never publishes it.
- The v3 → v4 step validates the UID/direct-owner graph, rebuilds reservations
  from that graph, and changes descendant scope to the owning Project or
  ControlSession. Every member of a root-wide same-kind duplicate group moves
  to its exact UID name. If one of those destinations is held by a resource
  outside the set, the holder is added until destination closure reaches a
  fixed point; every unique name outside that closure is preserved. The sorted
  name mapping and content-free receipts for removed `metadata.displayName` and
  `status.displayTitle` keys are recorded beside the exact-byte v3 backup. A
  present empty key records zero bytes and SHA-256 of empty content without
  being counted as information loss.
- The v1 repair is deterministic over Registry order apart from injected opaque
  uid generation. It preserves every existing uid, ownerRef, reserved name, and
  Agent conversation/session pointer. A valid Project anchor is never
  reselected. Otherwise it selects the first valid Project-owned Window and
  direct shell-Pane chain; a Window with no valid direct shell promotes its
  first direct shell or receives one bare shell, and a Project with no Window
  receives the minimum Window/Pane chain. A non-empty shell cwd that no longer
  names a directory is downgraded to the Project root. Every repair is recorded
  in `MigrationReport`; replaced declared fields are separately marked as
  information loss, while created Window/Pane resources are additive repair.
  Production and golden tests call the same pure repair algorithm with injected
  directory-existence and uid adapters.
- The canonical anchor is a schema-v2 write invariant. Until the separately
  planned Project-start projection lands, the legacy `New` startup path's
  prune-to-zero transaction fails validation and commits zero Registry bytes.
  The Registry verdict precedes snapshot deletion, so that rejection also
  preserves the latest snapshot byte-for-byte and performs no tmux mutation.
  This fail-closed ordering is not Phase 3 authority to redesign Project start.
- Downgrade writes remain unsupported. Unversioned, malformed, and future
  envelopes still fail closed before backup, staging, or replace.
- **Final schema-v2 Window shape:** the first public v2 contract has required
  `anchorPaneRef` and optional `defaultShellPaneRef`. Unpublished v2 files with
  `primaryPaneRef` are normalized under the Registry lock after an exact backup
  and durable checksum report. A v1 file migrates directly to this final shape.
  Mixed legacy/final authority is refused; the final writer emits no
  `primaryPaneRef`; and a second final-v2 pass writes zero bytes.
- **Field spelling:** the registry file intentionally uses the resource-model
  camelCase spelling (`apiVersion`, `schemaVersion`, `metadata`, `ownerRef`,
  `anchorPaneRef`, `defaultShellPaneRef`, `spec`, `status`) rather than the snake_case
  used by the older projmux on-disk JSON. The two spellings coexist on purpose:
  existing snake_case files are **not** retro-changed, and the resource registry
  follows the resource-model contract.

Durable recovery envelope:

- The registry is the source of truth for managed identity and desired topology,
  so `registry.json` is not the whole state: beside it the store keeps
  `registry.initialized`, the marker that records a completed write, and
  `recovery/`, a bounded set of the bytes replaced by semantic writes. The marker
  and every copy are 0600, `recovery/` is 0700 like the directory above it, and
  **no read creates any of them**.
- **First use versus state loss.** Before the first successful write there is no
  marker, and an absent, empty, or whitespace-only registry is the empty
  first-use registry — the zero-write read contract is unchanged, including the
  `LoadReadOnly` short-circuit that must not materialize
  `<state>/projmux/metadata/` for an operator who has never registered a
  resource. Once the marker exists, the same content-free registry is
  `ErrRegistryStateLost` on ordinary loads and mutations. Recovery inspection
  still classifies the missing or empty state and stays available to the repair
  route. Answering an empty registry there would hide the loss of every uid,
  name reservation, and offline resource, and the next mutation would mint a
  second identity domain on top of it. A registry written before the marker
  existed is ordinary state, not a loss, and gains the marker on its next write.
- **Rolling recovery copies.** A same-version semantic write copies the bytes it
  is about to replace to `recovery/registry-<stamp>-<seq>.json` before the
  replace. Only *verified* bytes are copied: an absent, empty, or
  structurally invalid prior file yields no copy. An invalid Registry blocks
  every ordinary write; only the separately validated, explicitly sourced
  recovery route may replace it. Retention keeps the newest five and removes the
  rest deterministically — names sort chronologically, and the sequence
  continues past the newest name rather than reusing one retention freed. A
  migration keeps its own versioned `.bak` instead, so it never spends a
  recovery slot on bytes that already have a backup.
- **A convergent no-op writes nothing at all.** `UpdateConvergent` on an
  unchanged registry takes no recovery copy, publishes no marker, and leaves the
  registry's bytes, mtime, and inode untouched. Convergence agreeing with stored
  state is not a reason to replace it.
- **Write sequence.** Stage into a temp file in the same directory → `fsync` it →
  re-read and validate it → copy the prior verified bytes → publish the marker if
  absent → `fsync` the directory → atomic `rename` → `fsync` the directory again.
  The live registry is only ever touched by that rename, and every step before it
  is undone on failure, so an injected or real failure at any step leaves the
  prior registry byte-identical with no staged file, no orphan copy, and no
  half-created marker. Directory `fsync` is best effort for filesystems that
  reject it (DrvFs and friends, the same ones that reject the permission repair),
  because losing the ability to write state there would be worse than losing the
  ordering guarantee.
- The marker is published **before** the rename so that its own failure cannot
  leave a replaced registry behind. The cost is a crash window of one rename: a
  hard crash between the marker and the very first registry rename leaves a
  marker with no registry, which reads as state loss rather than first use. That
  direction is deliberate — it asks the operator instead of silently starting
  over — and the diagnostic names the marker so it can be removed to accept an
  empty registry.
- **Distinct diagnostics.** Missing-after-initialization
  (`ErrRegistryStateLost`), malformed (`ErrMalformedRegistry`), too new
  (`ErrSchemaTooNew`), and unreadable (`ErrRegistryPermission`) stay four
  separate causes classified with `errors.Is`, because they ask for four
  different repairs. None of them creates an empty registry or a uid.
- **Restore is a separate operation.** Producing and bounding the copies is a
  property of a write; selecting one and putting it back is an operator decision,
  so it lives in the recovery boundary below rather than in the write path.

Degraded Registry mode:

- `valid` and a legitimate `first-use` are the only states from which an
  ordinary mutation may begin. Missing or empty state after initialization,
  malformed JSON, unsupported/newer schema, an invalid resource graph, and an
  unreadable Registry enter degraded mode. This is a command-scoped
  classification, not a sticky process flag: a successful repair makes the next
  mutation healthy again.
- Ordinary writes classify before entering the normal mutation lock and repeat
  the graph guard after acquiring it. A degraded refusal wraps the existing
  typed cause, states that ordinary mutations are disabled, and ends with the
  exact no-write next command: `projmux reconcile registry --dry-run`. It never
  leaves a raw validation error as the whole diagnosis and never chooses a
  recovery source for the operator.
- Public resource reads explicitly opt into the degraded decode path, so a
  decodable invalid graph remains available without weakening ordinary
  low-level Store loads. Recovery inspection can
  diagnose even malformed, missing, empty, unsupported, or graph-invalid bytes.
  `projmux reconcile registry` is the only write allowed to replace degraded
  Registry bytes. Other reconcile, create, rename, rebind, delete, lifecycle,
  and convergence writes stay on the ordinary gate.

Registry recovery boundary (`projmux reconcile registry`):

- **Two operations with deliberately different powers.** Planning classifies the
  current registry and every bounded candidate and writes nothing at all — no
  lock, no permission repair, no directory creation, no tmux mutation. Restoring
  publishes exactly one source the operator named. There is no "just fix it"
  mode: which copy is the truth is a judgment about which mutations were wanted,
  and the command never makes it.
- **A separate repair transaction.** Restore serializes on
  `registry.json.repair.lock`, never acquires or waits for the ordinary
  `registry.json.lock`, and therefore remains available when a failed or stale
  ordinary writer holds that lock. This is not a validation bypass: the operator
  must name one source; the source is classified and graph-validated before and
  under the recovery lock; the staged bytes are classified and graph-validated
  again; and source/current checksums are rechecked immediately before publish.
- **Classification, not authority.** A plan reports the current registry and each
  candidate as `valid`, `first-use`, `missing`, `empty`, `malformed`,
  `schema-too-new`, `invalid`, or `unreadable`, with a `sha256:` digest of the
  exact bytes, size, mtime, and the resource/reservation counts a verified
  envelope holds. Only `valid` is restorable. The same classifier runs at publish
  time, so a source is never previewed one way and validated another.
- **Fail-closed on the source.** Malformed JSON, an empty file, an envelope newer
  than this build, and a graph that decodes but holds a duplicate uid, a dangling
  `ownerRef`, or a broken name reservation are all refused. Restoring an
  unverified source would replace a known-damaged registry with an
  unknown-damaged one, and the second state is worse because it looks healthy.
- **Byte-semantic current restore and canonical v3 import.** A verified v4
  source is published verbatim. A verified v3 source is never made live in its
  legacy form: its exact bytes are first written to a versioned backup, a
  checksum-bearing content-free migration report is published beside that
  backup, and the same deterministic v3 → v4 migration used by normal Registry
  loading supplies the staged live bytes. Repeat restore compares the live
  Registry with that canonical publish checksum, so it writes no new Registry,
  backup, or report bytes.
- **The bytes being replaced are kept.** A restore copies the current registry to
  `recovery/replaced-<stamp>-<seq>.json` before replacing it, and unlike the
  write-side copy it keeps content that does **not** verify — that damaged
  registry is the only remaining evidence if the restore turns out to be the wrong
  call. Replaced copies are their own bounded family, so a restore never consumes
  the automatic write history and never grows without bound.
- **Race guards.** `--expect-source-checksum` and `--expect-current-checksum` tie
  a restore to the plan it was read from, and the preview prints the exact guarded
  command. Underneath, the source is re-read and re-verified under the recovery
  lock, the staged copy is re-validated, and both inputs are re-hashed immediately
  before the single rename. Anything that moved refuses with the registry
  byte-identical and tells the operator to re-run the preview.
- **A repeat restore is a byte no-op.** Bytes already equal to the source mean no
  rename, no preserved copy, and no marker write.
- **Restore establishes the boundary.** Restoring into a state directory with no
  marker publishes one, so a later loss on that machine reads as state loss rather
  than as a fresh first use.
- **The live tmux mirror is evidence, never a source.** When no verified copy
  exists, the plan reports what identity the *exact* server can still testify to —
  mirrored Project/Window/Pane uids, names, the Project root, and containment
  resolved from stable tmux ids — beside a fixed statement of what no mirror can
  return: offline resources, every Agent (no tmux option carries an Agent uid),
  an Agent-owned Pane's `ownerRef`, the name reservation table,
  `spec.anchorPaneRef`, `spec.defaultShellPaneRef`, and labels/annotations/timestamps/status. A pane carrying
  a provider option is counted as proof that an Agent existed whose own uid is
  nowhere on the server. Nothing is imported and no registry is generated:
  rebuilding from fragments would convert a visible loss into an invisible one.
- **No transport is a reason, not an error.** A restore is a filesystem
  operation, so planning works outside tmux; the mirror section simply reports
  that it has no exact target. The diagnostic is also skipped entirely when a
  verified copy exists or the registry is healthy, so it never answers a question
  nobody asked.

Resolved resource graph (`internal/core/resourcegraph`):

- **One join, consumed by everything.** The Registry is the source of truth for
  managed identity and logical desired topology; a runtime observation is a status
  overlay. `Resolve(registry, inventory)` produces the typed read model that the
  controller, the runtime diagnostics surface, and the primary UI all consume, so
  "is this Window live" and "may I mutate this pane" have one answer instead of
  one per call site.
- **Rows come from the Registry, objects come from the machine.** Every Registry
  row is emitted whatever the observation said, and every observed tmux object is
  named and classified even when projmux owns none of it. Neither direction can
  delete or invent the other's members.
- **Exact evidence only.** Attribution uses mirrored uids, the mirrored owner uid,
  the exact session role value, and the stable containment ids tmux itself
  reports. Session name, working directory, and running command are never
  ownership keys: a heuristic merge here would attach an operator's unrelated
  shell to a managed resource, and a wrong identity is worse than an unattributed
  object.
- **Closed attribution set.** `managed` is a Registry resource, or the object bound
  to one; `recoverable` mirrors a uid this Registry does not contain; `control` is
  an app-owned session carrying the exact `@projmux_session_role=control` marker;
  `ephemeral` is an auto-attach scratch session; `unattributed` has no mirrored
  identity but sits inside a managed enclosure or on a server projmux started;
  `foreign` has neither and belongs to the operator's own tmux; `conflict` is
  evidence that contradicts itself.
- **Contradiction refuses to bind.** One uid claimed by two live objects, a uid
  mirrored onto the wrong kind of object, and a claim whose live containment names
  a different owner than the Registry does are all recorded as conflicts with both
  tmux handles, and the row is never reported live and never handed a transport
  handle. Absent containment evidence is not a contradiction: a session that lost
  its Project option says nothing about ownership, so the object's own exact uid
  still binds. A binding that would cross a Project boundary is impossible by
  construction.
- **Status is derived, never stored.** `missing-root` outranks every runtime
  answer, a bound handle is `live`, a scope that could not be observed is
  `unknown` with a stated reason, and only a readable observation with no handle is
  `offline`. An empty or failed observation can only downgrade a row; it can never
  invent a live one. An Agent has no tmux object of its own, so its status is its
  current managed Pane's status and its phase is reported from the Registry
  verbatim.
- **Partial failure stays partial.** The host-ownership probe and the three list
  queries are independent scopes. A failed windows query leaves Window rows
  `unknown` while Pane rows keep their own observation, because a pane that is
  provably gone is still offline. A socket with no server behind it is different
  again: that is definite knowledge that nothing is live, so rows read `offline`
  and only host ownership is unavailable.
- **Both hosts, one identity.** `@projmux_app=1` on the server is the only proof
  of an app-owned host; anything else is a standalone host projmux is a guest on.
  The same Registry and the same objects produce identical managed rows under both,
  and a control-role marker on a server projmux does not own is refused, because
  any process can set an option on the operator's tmux.
- **Explicit transport or none.** An observation is routed through exactly one
  `-L <name>` or `-S <absolute path>`, resolved from the explicit socket flags
  first and the inherited `$TMUX` socket path second. There is no implicit
  default-server probe: with no transport the graph is a Registry-only snapshot
  whose runtime answers are all `unknown`, and a sibling socket is never read.
- **Bounded and pure.** One observation costs one option probe plus three list
  queries whatever the size of the server, is memoized for the invocation rather
  than cached with a TTL — closing a pane must make the *next* command report it
  offline — and issues no write verb. `Resolve` itself touches no filesystem, no
  process, and no tmux, so the same inputs always produce byte-identical output
  and a read can never materialize state.

Session State interoperability:

- Session snapshots carry resource identity through additive `omitempty`
  `metadata` blocks at the unchanged snapshot `version: 1` — one for the owning
  Project at the top level, one per Window, and one per Pane, each with
  `uid`, `name`, `labels`, `owner_kind`, and `owner_uid` in the snapshot's own
  snake_case spelling. No schema bump was needed, and a snapshot written
  without resource metadata still serializes byte-identically to the older form.
- Snapshots written before resource metadata existed still project
  deterministically into an explicitly selected, closed Registry Project:
  existing Windows and Panes are reused positionally in Registry order and any
  additional descendants receive new stable identities. Restore validates a
  pure Project-scoped plan, atomically commits that desired subtree, and only
  then invokes the ordinary Project materializer. It never directly replays
  snapshot topology into tmux and never replaces the global Registry.

tmux transport mirror:

- Live resources mirror identity into tmux options: `@projmux_project_uid` and
  `@projmux_project_name` on the session, the new window-scoped
  `@projmux_window_uid` and `@projmux_window_name`, and pane-scoped
  `@projmux_pane_uid` plus the existing `@projmux_pane_label` as the Pane
  **name** mirror. These are the first window-scoped projmux options; every
  earlier one was pane-, session-, or global-scoped.
- Opening an unregistered directory is the gesture that mints a Project, and the
  same flow finishes that Project's identity mirror. The first open takes the
  shipped `EnsureSession` path -- which writes only the `@projmux_project_path`
  anchor -- so the open itself writes `@projmux_project_uid` and
  `@projmux_project_name` onto the session it just created, after the session
  exists and before the client moves. It uses the same `MirrorProject` writer
  every other mirror goes through, on the same plain `tmux` transport the session
  was created on. The write is gated strictly on "this open registered the
  Project": every already-registered Project converges through the Registry
  topology engine, including desired state previously committed from a snapshot,
  and opening `$HOME` mints no managed identity at all, so neither writes a mirror
  option through this first-open gate. That gate is also what makes repeating an
  open write nothing. Repairing a session that is already live without its
  identity mirror is not this path's job: `projmux reconcile resources` is the
  recovery route.
- `rename pane` changes `Pane.metadata.name` and its `@projmux_pane_label`
  mirror only. It never writes the raw tmux `pane_title`.
- `rename window` is the explicit stable-identity path: it changes only
  `Window.metadata.name`, its root-scoped same-kind name reservation, and the
  exact live `@projmux_window_name` transport mirror. It does not change tmux
  `window_name`.
- `rename project` likewise writes only `Project.metadata.name` and the exact
  live session's `@projmux_project_name`; it never renames the tmux session.
  `rebind project` preserves the Project uid and session name while updating
  `spec.root` and the exact live session's `@projmux_project_path`. Neither
  operation moves files.
- `rename agent` changes only the root-scoped Agent `metadata.name` and its
  reservation. Agent topic annotations, provider, lifecycle status, and the
  managed Pane's name and raw title are independent and receive no tmux write.
- Rename/rebind commits the authoritative Registry transaction before its
  field-specific live projection. Immediate projection is enabled only inside
  tmux from an inherited absolute socket path; every inventory and write is
  routed through that exact `-S` socket, and Project/Window writes target stable
  `$N`/`@N` handles rather than mutable names or indices. Outside tmux no server
  is probed and the operation is Registry-only. If no exact UID target is
  observed, including when the exact inventory is unavailable, the resource is
  treated as offline and the durable drift is left for a later explicit-socket
  reconciliation. Once an exact target is found, a write failure or duplicate
  UID claim is nonzero and reports that Registry state committed plus
  `projmux reconcile resources` as the retry boundary.
- The configured `window.rename` action (`Ctrl-M` by default) is the runtime
  display path and invokes tmux `rename-window` directly. Reads may observe that
  exact live `window_name` as invocation-scoped context; reconciliation never
  persists it as a Registry address or presentation field.
- Registry-managed Windows are set to `automatic-rename off` so a focused-Pane
  change cannot overwrite the Window name. The **global** `automatic-rename on`
  plus visible-pane-label `automatic-rename-format` default in the generated
  app config is unchanged, so unmanaged windows keep their existing behavior.
- Legacy import gives every newly discovered Window, Pane, and Agent its exact
  minted UID as the automatic Registry name and switches managed Windows to
  `automatic-rename off`. Observed `window_name`, Pane label/title, command,
  shell, provider, and topic are never persisted as an address or presentation
  field. Re-observing an existing resource preserves its UID, stable name,
  ownerRef, and reservation. `@projmux_window_name` and
  `@projmux_pane_label` remain live mirrors of the durable name.
- `Pane.metadata.name` is the stable Pane address. Human-readable Pane context
  is derived per invocation from the owner Agent topic/provider, command, and
  exact live title; it is never a selector, identity, or Window name source.

Runtime observation and resource status:

- **Status is an observation; spec is stored and authoritative.** A read verb
  never trusts a stored liveness value. `Window` and `Pane` status is derived
  per invocation from a live tmux snapshot: a resource is `live` only while a
  live tmux object still mirrors its `@projmux_window_uid` /
  `@projmux_pane_uid`. A registry object bound to nothing live is an **orphan**,
  and an orphan is not live.
- `selector.ObservedStatus(missingRoot, bound)` is the **single** derivation
  rule in the codebase, and every kind goes through it. `missing-root` outranks
  everything, then `bound` decides `live` vs `offline`. The MissingRoot
  precedence contract is unchanged, and it now applies to a Window or Pane whose
  owning Project lost its root even while tmux is still running them.
- A **Project** is the one kind whose runtime object is a tmux *session*, which
  has no `@projmux` uid of its own, so Project status still reads
  `status.session` as refreshed by the reconciler.
- An **Agent** owns no tmux object of its own — there is no `@projmux_agent_uid`
  and there must not be one, because an Agent outlives the managed Pane it is
  bound to. Its runtime object is **that managed Pane**, named by
  `status.paneRef`, and that is what is observed: an Agent is `live` only while
  a live tmux pane still mirrors the uid its `paneRef` points at. An empty
  `paneRef` — the state of every pending Agent and of every released or failed
  one that was not anchoring its Window — is `offline`, and `missing-root` still
  outranks both. A released Agent that kept an anchor binding reads `offline` by
  the same rule rather than by an empty ref: the Pane it still names is the one
  whose runtime just disappeared.
- Agent status is **not** inherited from the owning Window. It used to be, and
  that was the last surviving inheritance path: once one Window was adopted and
  went live, every Agent under it read `live` whether or not it had a pane, so
  `get agents` said `live` for a resource `describe agent` reported as `Offline`
  with no managed pane. The Window now contributes exactly one fact — whether
  the owning Project carries `MissingRoot` — and specifically not its liveness.
- `status.phase` is **not** an input to status either. Phase is lifecycle (a
  stored value, owned by the Agent liveness rules) and Status is observation;
  folding a stored value back into the observation is what the contract forbids.
  They cannot contradict anyway: a non-`Running` transition either clears
  `paneRef` or keeps one that names a Pane whose runtime is gone, so a
  non-`Running` Agent has no *live* runtime object to observe either way.
- The observation is taken **at the command entrypoint, once per process
  invocation**, and costs exactly two reads: `list-panes -a` and
  `list-windows -a` (~3ms each). It is lazy, so a route that never renders
  status never pays for it. It is **not** cached and **not** persisted: closing
  a pane must make the *next* query report it offline, and a TTL would defeat
  exactly that. It is also not a per-route reconcile, because the read verbs
  load the registry read-only and must never materialize
  `<state>/projmux/metadata/`.
- A failed inventory query yields an **empty** observation, never a fallback to
  a stored value. Empty can only downgrade a resource to offline; it can never
  invent a live one, and "nothing is live" is the truthful answer for a machine
  whose tmux server is not up.
- The reconciler runs the same diff on the mutation routes and records **why** a
  runtime object went away as a `MissingRuntime` condition
  (`reason: RuntimeUnbound`) on the Window or Pane, with `firstObservedAt`
  preserved across repeat observations and cleared when the object rebinds.
  `describe` renders it. This is an inventory diff, not an event handler, so it
  **converges with no hook firing**: the pane-exit hooks only accelerate the
  read verbs, which never reconcile.
- **A vanished runtime never deletes, prunes, or re-identifies a resource, and
  never releases a name reservation** — the same preservation contract
  `MissingRoot` established for a Project whose root disappeared. There is no
  auto-prune.
- Explicit canonical deletion is the authority that retires that preserved
  desired topology. A non-implicit `delete window` target (an explicit
  reference or `--all`) accepts zero exact Window mirrors on its selected
  socket as a Registry-only cascade through the Window's Agents and Panes. One
  exact mirror is killed before the Registry commit; duplicate, foreign,
  stale-owner, inventory-failure, and plan-to-execution race states remain
  fail-closed. An implicit active Window is never treated as offline.
- **`delete window|pane|agent` names its server the same way `reconcile
  resources` does**: explicit `--socket <name>`, explicit `--socket-path
  <absolute>`, or the inherited absolute `$TMUX`, and outside tmux with no flag
  it refuses. There used to be a fourth branch -- a hardcoded `-L projmux` --
  which meant a delete issued against an isolated server inventoried one host
  and killed objects on another. Refusing is the only remaining honest answer,
  and it names the two flags that fix it.
- The inventory is a pure **read**. It never writes, re-mirrors, or adopts a uid
  onto a live tmux object; reattaching a lost binding belongs to the reconciler
  (see *Binding reapply and adoption* below). After a tmux server restart the
  objects survive but the options do not, so everything reads offline until the
  next mutation route reconciles.
- The observation shells out as bare `tmux`, like every other mirror read, so
  inside a client `$TMUX` selects the projmux socket. Introducing a second
  socket convention for this one query would let the observation disagree with
  the mirror writes it is diffed against.

Binding reapply and adoption:

- The `@projmux_*_uid` tmux options are the binding store, and they used to be
  written **once**, at legacy-session import time. A tmux server restart, an
  option reset, or a registry written before the mirror existed leaves live
  windows and panes carrying no uid at all, and nothing ever put one back. The
  measured symptom: `projmux delete pane` with no selector fails with *the
  active tmux pane carries no `@projmux_pane_uid`* in almost every pane on the
  machine, making the shipped "omit the selector, act on the active target"
  behavior unreachable.
- Reconcile now **reapplies** bindings. Every live window and pane that resolves
  to a Project gets its uid options written again, through the same
  `Mirror.MirrorWindow` / `Mirror.MirrorPane` path an imported object uses.
  There is one write convention, not a uid-only variant: a reattached object
  must end up configured exactly like an imported one.
- The old import guard (*skip a Project that already owns Windows*) is gone. It
  **avoided** duplicates instead of repairing drift, so once the registry and
  the machine disagreed no later pass could bring them back together. Each
  observed tmux window now resolves into one of four outcomes — **rebound**
  (still carries a uid the Project owns), **adopted** (blank, pairs with the
  next unbound registry Window), **created** (blank, no candidate left), or
  **refused**. Panes cascade the same way inside a window that was itself
  matched. A drifted registry converges in a single pass.
- **The matching key is structural, never content.** Two layers: the Project
  scope, then ordinal alignment inside it — the session's tmux windows in
  `window_index` order against that Project's registry Windows in creation
  order, and panes the same way inside an adopted Window. That is the alignment
  the import path already created and `mirrorImported` already maps back
  through; adoption restores it rather than inventing one. `window_name`,
  `@projmux_window_name`, `@projmux_pane_label`, pane cwd, basename, git origin,
  and inode are explicitly **not** matching keys. Names are worthless here: the
  registry carries the Window name `zsh` across nine different Projects.
- **Two ways a session resolves to a Project, and they are disjoint.**
  `@projmux_project_path` is the *import* key — it is what turns an unknown
  session into a Project, and it is written only at session creation, so a
  session older than it has none. For those, reconcile uses the
  Project↔session-name edge it already maintains: a Project's session name is
  `status.session.name` when set, otherwise the name `sessionNameFor` gives its
  root. That is used **forward only** — compute the expected name from the
  Project and compare. Parsing a session name back into a path would be the
  heuristic. The session-name path never creates a **Window**; only the anchored
  import path does.
- **An orphan live pane is registered, and that is the one thing the
  session-name path creates.** Adoption needs an existing registry Pane to adopt
  *into*, and a pane produced by the earlier non-resource direct Agent bridge
  has none, so it stayed unbound forever and
  `projmux delete pane` with no selector kept refusing in the operator's own
  active pane. Reconcile therefore mints a **shell-role Pane owned by the
  already-paired Window** for every live pane inside it that matches nothing, and
  mirrors that Pane's uid back through the same `Mirror.MirrorPane` write. The
  Project boundary is structural rather than checked: the Window was paired
  earlier in the same walk and belongs to the single Project the session name
  resolved to, so there is no code path from a live pane to a Project it does not
  already sit under. A live *window* that matches nothing still creates nothing,
  and neither does a **refused** pane — a refusal means a real registry Pane sits
  on the other side of the ambiguity, so minting beside it would leave two Panes
  describing one tmux pane.
- The registered Pane uses its exact minted UID as `metadata.name`, never
  `pane_current_command`, the Pane label/title, or a numeric suffix. Those
  runtime values may contribute only to invocation-scoped context. The mint
  itself never creates an Agent: it adds one Pane and stops. Linking that Pane
  to an Agent is the separate step below, which runs on the Pane the walk just
  settled on.
- **Nothing is ever re-identified.** Adoption changes no uid, merges no uid, and
  reassigns no uid; it only decides which registry object a live tmux object is
  the runtime of, and then writes that object's existing uid. Adopted objects
  are reported to the reconciler so their bindings get written, but they are not
  recorded as *created* in the transaction — rolling an operation back must not
  delete an object that predates it.
- **Everything ambiguous is refused, and a refusal writes nothing.** The session
  resolves to no Project, or to more than one. The live object carries a uid
  another Project — or a sibling Window — owns. A candidate is already the
  binding of a different live tmux object, so the walk moves on rather than
  stealing it. Two live objects claim one uid. The parent window was not
  matched, so none of its panes are considered.
- A uid the registry has **never heard of** is its own case. It is never
  adopted: pointing an existing registry object at it would be re-identification
  off a failed lookup. The anchored import path still *mints* a new object for
  it, because projmux itself produces unknown uids — a reconcile rolled back by
  a pre-create hook refusal has already written its allocated uids onto tmux,
  and tmux options are not transactional — and refusing outright would leave
  those windows permanently unmanageable. Minting changes no existing uid. The
  session-name repair path, which has no anchor, mints only the Pane case and
  skips the window.
- The "already bound elsewhere" set is one observation taken **before** the pass
  writes anything, shared by both binding steps, so "already bound" means "bound
  before we got here". The binding writes land before the runtime-observation
  step, or that step would stamp `MissingRuntime` on a Window this same pass
  just reattached.

Lifecycle trigger convergence:

- Every mutation and lifecycle producer reaches **one** entrypoint. A producer
  states a reason from a closed set (`config-apply`, `runtime-created`,
  `runtime-exited`) and one exact tmux server; it does not choose which stages
  run or in what order. `projmux config apply --socket <name>` reaches it after
  config preflight and a successful `source-file`; the generated config's
  `after-new-window`, `after-split-window`, `pane-exited`, and `after-kill-pane`
  hooks reach it through the hidden `internal tmux converge` route, which is the
  only lifecycle route there is.
- The two exit hooks are in both generated configs; the two creation hooks are
  app-config only, and that asymmetry is the adoption boundary rather than an
  oversight. A convergence caused by a *new* runtime object mints and rebinds, so
  it adopts an unmarked window inside a managed enclosure. On the app-owned server
  every session is projmux's own and there is nothing to adopt by accident; the
  standalone snippet is sourced from the operator's `~/.tmux.conf` and therefore
  runs on every server they start, where a raw `new-window` in a session projmux
  does not own has to stay an unmanaged runtime object that only the Runtime
  diagnostics surface shows.
- A hook states that something on one exact server may have changed. Exact
  `pane-exited` additionally carries tmux's `%N` Pane and `@N` Window handles;
  kill and coalesced triggers deliberately carry no invented identity. Every
  hook expands tmux's own absolute `#{socket_path}` and `#{session_id}`, so
  neither the route nor the convergence it drives falls back to the default
  socket or inherited `$TMUX`.
- One convergence pass is one locked reconciliation followed by an exit-half
  reobservation. The reconciliation imports the live sessions it can attribute,
  reapplies the bindings it can prove, projects the lifecycle of every managed
  Pane whose runtime object died, and records why a Window or Pane lost one --
  all inside one registry transaction against one observation taken inside the
  lock. The projection has to run *after* the binding steps of the same pass:
  those steps mirror the uids the observation is diffed against, so an exit stage
  placed first would file an unknown termination against every Pane the pass was
  on its way to binding.
- At most one worker converges one exact server at a time, held as an advisory
  whole-file lease under `<state>/projmux/controller/`. Not because two would
  corrupt anything -- the registry's own lock prevents that -- but because both
  pane-exit hooks fire on every pane exit in every session, and a fleet of
  workers contending for one registry lock is how a burst becomes lock-attempt
  exhaustion instead of a convergence. A producer that loses the lease records
  its dirty event and exits successfully; the holder has not acknowledged that
  event yet, so it runs a further pass for it. The lease is `flock` rather than a
  timestamped lockfile so a worker that is killed or panics leaves nothing to
  break.
- The pass repeats until one of them writes nothing. That final no-op pass is the
  reobservation: a write that landed and did not converge -- a second client
  racing the same repair, a hook that rewrote an option back -- is exactly what a
  report claiming success must not hide. The loop is bounded; stopping early is
  safe in a way a lost event is not, because convergence is derived from the
  machine rather than from the event log.
- Project runtime stop and fresh identity separation Phase 1 pairs a qualifying
  last-Pane `pane-exited` with the exact matching `window-unlinked` by socket,
  `$N` session, `@N` Window, `%N` Pane, Registry
  owner chain, and activation generation. The first event stores only bounded
  teardown evidence; the second re-observes every Window in that exact session,
  including unmirrored siblings, before deleting anything. The guarded
  transaction deletes exactly that Window, its Panes, its owned Agents, and
  their reservations. A non-last Project Window reanchors to its existing
  sibling. The last Project Window leaves the exact Project uid, root,
  reservation, pins, and snapshot bytes in the valid zero-Window state. A
  ControlSession likewise loses only the Window and keeps its root uid.
  Abnormal/killed/unknown exits, stale generations, unpaired or foreign handles,
  unavailable/empty observations, and missing-server or permission failures
  retain the graph. A historical offline Window without the stored causal Pane
  receipt is never deleted from absence alone; its fixed diagnostic recovery is
  an exact canonical `delete window uid:<window-uid>` on the named socket. No
  pane content, command, prompt, history, or transcript is an authority input.
- Phase 2 gives Project startup and stop one closed lifecycle table. The input
  states are retained-window, zero-window, and deleted; the actions are Stop,
  Continue, Fresh, and explicit Project delete. Stop writes only the exact
  managed runtime and preserves every desired UID. Continue on retained-window
  writes only runtime and materializes the same descendant UIDs; Continue on
  zero-window atomically allocates one canonical Window/shell below the same
  Project UID before runtime materialization. The deleted+Continue cell accepts
  only a usable-snapshot precondition, then atomically creates a new Project UID
  and restores new descendant UIDs from that snapshot; without the precondition
  the same cell is an unavailable zero-write refusal and never falls back to
  Fresh. Fresh atomically replaces either
  registered state with a new Project/Window/shell UID chain and exactly one
  same-root claimant. Within this runtime/startup lifecycle table, canonical
  `delete project --yes` alone unregisters the Project graph; the separately
  scoped filesystem-missing `prune project` administrative policy is unchanged.
  Ordinary close-window is a separate operation class, so no one plan can also
  be stop, Fresh, or Project delete.
- The creation hooks stay synchronous so a newly bindable Window or Pane has a
  registry binding before the creating tmux command returns and before the next
  implicit read can run; the exit hooks stay backgrounded so closing a pane never
  waits on convergence. Mirror writes use `set-option` and `rename-window`, not
  creation commands, so they cannot recursively fire either creation hook.
- A canonical resource create already owns the registry transaction while it
  issues `new-window` or `split-window`. It therefore installs a private,
  session-scoped create lease before the mutation (`new-session -e` on first
  materialization), and the exact-socket hook inspects that lease using the
  expanded `#{session_id}`. Only a live lease defers the hook's registry entry;
  stale or malformed leases are cleared and normal synchronous convergence
  continues. The create path explicitly mirrors its objects, reconciles the
  resulting runtime again inside the same transaction, then ownership-checks
  and clears its lease after commit or rollback. This avoids lock reentry
  without weakening standalone lifecycle ordering.
- A tmux creation may return non-zero after the object exists when a later
  synchronous hook fails. Materialization retains the combined output, accepts
  a reported `@N` or `%N` only when it was absent from the before-inventory and
  present in the same target's after-inventory, mirrors its operation uid, and
  rolls it back in reverse order. Ambiguous handles and changed ownership fail
  closed: unrelated objects are preserved and residual drift is reported.
- `config apply --no-reload` stops before any live-server query, and config or
  keymap preflight failure does the same. A server on a second socket is never
  inventoried or mutated. `get`, `describe`, and implicit active-target
  resolution remain read-only and never invoke convergence or open a registry
  transaction.
- The existing `BindingMatcher`, `registryReconciler`, and metadata `Mirror`
  remain the only matcher, orchestrator, and tmux uid writer. Missing bindings
  take the existing complete mirror path; ambiguous and foreign objects keep
  the existing refusal rules. A resource already carrying its exact registry
  uid skips the mirror, and the convergent store suppresses an atomic registry
  replace when normalization finds no semantic change. Repeating apply or the
  lifecycle boundary therefore issues no `set-option`/`rename-window` writes
  and performs no registry byte write.
- This boundary adds no public command, option, environment variable, or
  registry schema. It does not add persistent Project scope, matching by name,
  cwd, or a new ordinal heuristic, uid merge/reassignment, pruning, or forced
  adoption. The Project scope remains derived from the active binding on read.
- There is no daemon and no auto-start. A trigger never resumes an Agent, never
  materializes an offline resource, and never adopts or deletes an unmanaged
  runtime object. Read verbs start no controller at all: `get`, `describe`, and
  implicit active-target resolution neither converge nor open a registry
  transaction, and they leave no controller event or lease behind.

Projmux split UI:

- Every split producer carries the exact popup origin as a typed canonical
  create intent. The origin must resolve through the mirrored Pane uid to its
  owner Window uid and then to exactly one Project or ControlSession uid; those
  Phase 11 declaration, root, role, Window, and Pane mirrors are the complete
  identity evidence. A ControlSession Pane's cwd is launch workspace only and
  never participates in root identity. If the origin disappears or its owner
  chain conflicts, canonical create performs no Registry or tmux write and
  projects the exact refusal to the originating tmux client.
- The default `ai-split-right/down` binding, the `Alt-7` provider picker, the
  resume picker, and the provider and shell direct actions all produce a
  canonical create intent -- which provider, which side, and for a resume which
  conversation -- and hand it to the same `create` route a typed command reaches.
  The provider and shell branches render the exact argv an operator would type,
  so a UI action and a typed command cannot disagree about what `--placement
  down` means.
- Only the materializer runs `split-window`. Before this convergence the saved
  default and both pickers descended into a legacy split that called tmux
  directly, so a pane opened from the UI was a runtime object the Registry had
  never heard of: no uid, no owner Window, no Agent row, and a Main UI row only
  once something else happened to reconcile. A raw unmanaged split now exists
  only where the operator makes one -- typing `tmux split-window`, or tmux's own
  pane-context-menu entries.
- The saved split mode is the one piece of hidden state the split UI reads, which
  is why the canonical `create agent` route refuses to read it: a canonical route
  whose result depends on state the operator cannot see in the argv is not
  canonical. A saved mode that names no launch opens the picker; a saved provider
  that Settings has since disabled fails clearly, before the intent exists, with
  zero Registry and zero tmux mutations.
- The resume picker joins a conversation the machine already has by reaching the
  same Agent allocation with the provider's *resume* argv substituted for its
  fresh-start argv. It is not `agent resume`: that verb rebinds an existing
  Registry Agent and must never fall through to a fresh conversation, while this
  interactive path may, because the operator picked a row and has already been
  told it could not be resumed.

Command-scoped controller kernel:

- One seam runs the whole sequence: observe one exact server, resolve it into a
  `resourcegraph.Graph`, plan, commit the Registry, guard tmux, execute, and
  reobserve. It is command-scoped and event-triggerable; there is no daemon.
- Authority is a closed table over intent x attribution plus one explicit grant,
  not a predicate. The grant is `OperatorTargeted`: this invocation names one
  exact server the operator chose. `reconcile resources` cannot run without such
  a target, and that selection -- nothing else -- is what makes an unmarked
  object on a host projmux does not own repairable. Without the grant `foreign`
  is refused, and with it every lifecycle intent still is.
  `start`, `import`, and `delete` are refused for every class, so an offline
  resource, Home, an ephemeral session, and an unattributed Pane cannot be
  created, adopted, or removed by convergence. Repair is allowed on `managed`
  and on `unattributed` -- an unmarked object inside projmux's own runtime world
  carries no competing identity, so restoring a Registry-owned mirror overwrites
  nobody. `recoverable`, `foreign`, and `conflict` are refused; `control` and
  `ephemeral` are observe-only. An unknown class fails closed.
- A planned write must also carry one of the two convergence verbs,
  `set-option` or `rename-window`. The verb gate is what makes "convergence
  never created or killed a runtime object" structural rather than a property of
  which candidates happen to exist today.
- The plan is totally ordered: registry surface before tmux surface, then
  outermost containment first, then by stable key. Containment order is load
  bearing -- a Pane uid written into a Window that does not yet carry its own uid
  is attributable to nothing, and the next pass reads it as a Pane outside its
  owner scope.
- Guards are exact evidence captured at observation time and re-proved
  immediately before the first live write, all or nothing: the server's own
  `#{socket_path}`, the target's mirrored uid, and the containing object's id.
  A stale guard aborts having written nothing and reports the exact retry.
- After a run that changed anything, the kernel replans against fresh bytes and
  reports whether a repeat would write. Convergence is observed, not assumed.
- Explicit topology materialization keeps its own engine and its own
  plan-time guard, because it plans against objects it is about to create, which
  no prior observation can have seen.

Runtime diagnostics escape hatch:

- A Registry-first surface is not an inventory, and that is the point of this
  one. The managed UI lists Registry resources, so an operator's own shell, the
  Home control session, a scratch session, and anything on a server projmux is a
  guest on are all correctly absent from it -- and "correctly absent" is
  indistinguishable from "lost" without a surface that shows the machine as it
  is. `projmux get runtime sessions|windows|panes` and the `projmux runtime
  diagnostics` picker are that surface.
- It is a projection of `resourcegraph`, not a second join. Every row comes from
  the resolved graph, which already decided attribution from exact uid, owner,
  and role evidence; nothing here re-derives a class and nothing here consults a
  session name, a working directory, or a running command. Every observed object
  is emitted, managed ones included, because a managed object that needs no
  repair is exactly the row an operator looks for when the managed UI shows it
  and the machine seems not to.
- Two handles per row, and they are not interchangeable. The stable tmux id is
  the only thing worth storing; the qualified coordinate -- a session name,
  `<session>:@N`, `<session>:@N.%N` -- is what an operator and the focus route
  address the object by. The session half of a coordinate degrades from the
  observed name to the `$N` id, and an object whose enclosing session cannot be
  resolved gets no coordinate at all rather than an unqualified handle the focus
  grammar would read as a session name.
- One exact host, and no transport is an answer. The routing is an explicit
  `--socket`/`--socket-path` or the inherited `$TMUX` socket path, never a
  default-server probe and never a second socket. Outside tmux the read succeeds
  and reports every scope unavailable with a stated reason, where `reconcile
  resources` refuses the same case because it is about to write.
- The whole surface is read-only. The Registry is opened without creating it,
  the observation is the bounded four-query adapter that owns no write verb, and
  the projection is pure, so a refresh is indistinguishable from not having run
  it. An empty item list next to a populated unavailability list is a different
  answer from an empty item list beside none.
- The picker's actions are forwards, not features. `focus` moves a client and
  never materializes, `attach project` is the outside-tmux Project entry point,
  and the Resource Inspector is read-only; each is offered only where it
  applies, and where it does not the row states why. There is deliberately no
  adopt, import, rename, or kill: a diagnostic surface that could adopt what it
  found would be the heuristic merge the resolved graph refuses, wearing a menu.
- `projmux runtime diagnostics` stays separate from `projmux runtime sessions`.
  That picker lists recent sessions to open one; this one lists every object on
  the server to explain what it is. Merging them would put an operator's own
  shell into the open-a-session list.

Registry-first primary navigation:

- The primary surfaces enumerate the Registry, not the machine. `internal/core/
  registryview` builds their rows from a resolved graph, so a Project is a row
  because the Registry contains it and not because a tmux session exists. The
  runtime contributes a status -- live, offline, missing-root, or unknown -- and
  an exact handle, and nothing else.
- Identity is the Registry's. Membership and order in `registryview` are the
  Registry's own slice order, which is insertion order, and the pure view model
  applies no preference of its own: the same Registry projects the same rows in
  the same order on an app-owned server, on a standalone server, and outside tmux
  entirely.
- Presentation order is the sidebar's, and only the sidebar's. The Projects list
  projects the managed rows onto three tiers -- pinned, then live, then closed --
  and preserves Registry order inside each tier as a stable tie-break. Pinned
  outranks live because a pin is a stated preference and liveness is an accident
  of the moment, so a pinned offline Project stays above an unpinned live one. The
  live tier is an overlay of one exact host, which makes two things contractual:
  the tier of a row may differ between hosts and between refreshes, and the
  selection may not follow a position. It follows the Project uid -- the old
  selection is resolved to its Project and that Project back to whatever row it
  renders as now -- so a tier change moves the row and not the resource the cursor
  is on. Nothing about a tier reaches the Registry: it is not stored, not
  reconciled, and not part of desired topology.
- Row identity is the resource uid. A managed Project's *selection* is still its
  `spec.root` so the shipped open flow is unchanged, except for a Project whose
  root is gone: that row carries `uid:<uid>` and selecting it opens the read-only
  resource surface, which is where rebind is stated. Before this, such a row
  failed the whole picker on directory validation.
- Filesystem discovery is kept and demoted. A discovered directory that no
  Project root claims is an unregistered bootstrap candidate in its own section;
  one that is already a Project root is dropped rather than listed twice with a
  second set of actions. Opening a candidate is the explicit gesture that
  registers it -- see the authority split below.
- Home is chrome, not a Project, and the three senses of "Home" stay separate;
  *Home and root kinds* under the resource metadata model is the canonical
  statement and this row-level detail follows from it. The
  Home *control session* is never a managed row: the tmux session itself is app
  control runtime with no `resourceRef`, the only evidence that a session is one
  is the exact `@projmux_session_role` value the graph reads, and a session named
  `home` with no marker is honestly unattributed. The marker is written by the
  canonical `projmux shell` entry, for the app-session target only, and the same
  pass mirrors Home's Window and Pane identity -- so Home's *windows and panes*
  are managed rows owned by a `ControlSession`, while the session row itself
  stays `control`. Home is still not a Project and never appears in
  `get projects`. The Home *navigation row* is the operator's own root as
  filesystem discovery offers it, and it leads the Projects list because it is
  where the surface starts from rather than a member of what the surface orders.
  It is synthesized from nothing: it carries no managed identity, it is not a
  reconcile or create target, and if discovery does not offer `$HOME` there is no
  Home row.
- The Sessions and Recent Windows surfaces list managed rows only, attributed by
  tmux's own `$N` and `@N` ids rather than by a name join, and carry the Registry
  resource name beside the exact tmux handle their actions target. What they
  withhold is tallied by class on a Runtime link that forwards to the escape
  hatch above.
- The Projects sidebar's Runtime link is conditional, and only the link is.
  `Settings > Projects > Project Sidebar > Runtime diagnostics` chooses between
  `Always`, which is the shipped behavior, and `When needed`, which is the
  read-time default with nothing saved and no install migrated to it. `When
  needed` offers the row when the refused classes -- `Unattributed`, `Foreign`,
  `Recoverable`, `Conflict` -- sum above zero, or when the observation could not
  be taken: no transport, or any scope the inventory marked unavailable. Not
  being able to look is not the same as nothing being there, so a failed
  observation keeps the escape hatch reachable rather than hiding it.
  `Control` and `Ephemeral` are deliberately outside that sum: the app's own
  control session and a scratch session are what a healthy host looks like, and
  counting them would put the row back on every render. The decision is purely
  presentational -- `registryview` still emits a complete Runtime row and a
  complete class tally, a visible row carries its exact shipped label and tally,
  the Sessions and Recent Windows links are untouched, and `projmux runtime
  diagnostics` and `projmux get runtime ...` never read the preference. Hiding a
  row is not disabling a capability. An unreadable or unrecognized saved value
  resolves to `When needed` without writing anything and says so in Settings.
- Every action forwards to a route that already owns it: `focus` for a live row,
  `attach project` for an offline Project -- the one shipped route that
  materializes one -- and `agent resume` for an Agent. Rebind and delete are
  listed as eligible with the exact command that performs them rather than
  executed from a read surface.
- A navigation refresh is a read. It opens the Registry read-only, takes the
  bounded four-query observation through one exact socket, and projects it
  purely: no Registry or tmux write, no reconcile, no materialize, and no
  default-server probe when there is no transport.

Project discovery and pin authority:

Five things used to share two files, and each of them answered a different
question wrongly as a result. Workdirs were a scan source *and* the thing that
decided which Projects existed. The pin file was a presentation preference *and*
a discovery input *and* the only record that a directory mattered. They are five
separate authorities now, and the boundaries are the point.

- **Workdirs and project roots are scan roots.** `PROJMUX_MANAGED_ROOTS`,
  `PROJMUX_PROJDIR` and `~/.config/projmux/workdirs` name directories to look
  inside. Looking inside a directory registers nothing. On Windows they are
  OS-native paths and stay OS-native paths; nothing normalizes them into identity.
- **A discovered child is an unregistered candidate.** It is a filesystem fact
  with no uid, no name reservation, and no Registry row. It stays one until
  something explicitly registers it, however many times it is scanned, rendered,
  or reconciled.
- **The Registry is managed identity.** `projmux create project --root <path>` is
  the canonical bootstrap, and opening a candidate from the Projects sidebar
  performs the same registration for that one exact path. Both go through one
  transaction and both are idempotent: a root an existing Project already claims
  is answered from the Registry and writes nothing. Nothing else registers a
  Project. In particular the reconcile prelude no longer walks the discovery
  roots, so `create pane` in one repository cannot add a Project for every
  sibling directory under a scan root -- which is exactly what it used to do.
  `--project <name>` naming an unregistered candidate is a refusal that names the
  exact `--root` and the route that would register it.
- **A managed pin is a Registry Project uid.** Its displayed root and name are
  projected from the Registry on every render, so the pin survives a rebind, a
  rename, and a `MissingRoot` condition. The sidebar tier reads the uid, never the
  path.
- **A candidate pin is a path no Project claims.** It is a preference about a
  directory, kept as one. Rendering it, listing it, and pinning it never mint a
  Project.

Storage and migration:

- The pin file is a typed envelope: a `projmux-pins v2` header followed by
  `project <uid>` and `candidate <path>` lines. The kind is stored, not inferred,
  which is what lets one file hold both collections without either surface having
  to guess.
- Reading never writes. Every rendering surface projects a pre-v2 file in memory
  through the same resolution a migration would persist, so the sidebar is
  identical before and after `projmux pin project migrate`.
- Migration is per-line and atomic as a whole. A path exactly one Project's root
  claims becomes that uid; a path no Project claims stays a candidate; a path more
  than one Project claims refuses the entire migration with the pin file and the
  Registry byte-identical, and names the repair. A corrupt or newer-version
  envelope is refused rather than partially parsed, because a wrong guess about
  which resource a preference points at is worse than declining to load one.
- Path folding is confined to two questions: candidate exact-match, and legacy
  path-to-uid migration. `candidates.MatchKeyFor` resolves symlinks on every
  platform and additionally folds separator, case, and drive-letter case on
  Windows, so `C:\Users\dev\src` and `c:/users/dev/src` are one candidate. It is
  never an identity operation: no amount of path agreement mints a Project uid or
  merges two, and the Windows rules are frozen by a compatibility table that a
  Linux test run asserts.
- `pin project add|remove|toggle <dir>` keeps working unchanged and now resolves
  to a typed pin under one rule -- exactly one Project with that root makes the pin
  managed, none makes it a candidate, more than one is refused -- with
  `uid:<uid>` available when an operator wants to be explicit. Settings shows the
  three collections as three collections: Additional discovery roots, Pinned
  Projects, and Candidate Pins.

Public resource reconciliation:

- `projmux reconcile resources` exposes the same Registry matcher, mutator,
  reconciler, and tmux Mirror as a deliberate operator repair boundary. A
  shadow tmux runner delegates reads to one exact server, records mirror writes,
  and overlays only those recorded UID values for the reconciler's final
  observation. Planning therefore executes production convergence on a cloned
  Registry while writing zero Registry, tmux, or filesystem bytes.
- Plan item identity is stable by resource kind, live target or Registry scope,
  and action. Opaque UIDs allocated while planning are display details
  normalized to deterministic placeholders; they are not matching keys and do
  not obscure owner or target identity. Human and JSON output share the same
  sorted items and missing/stale/foreign/orphan vocabulary.
- Execute runs through the controller kernel. It rebuilds the plan from the
  locked current Registry and authorizes every runtime write against the graph
  resolved from the pre-lock observation. Runtime observation is limited to the
  Registry Project graphs safely attributable to sessions on the selected
  socket; absence there never marks another socket's graph missing or releases
  its Agents. The desired Registry is validated and committed before any
  non-transactional tmux mirror write, keeping Registry identity authoritative
  and retryable if a later live step fails. After commit, the socket identity
  and every planned write's uid and containment guards are re-proved from the
  exact socket; all of them must still match before the first write. A recycled,
  moved, or raced handle therefore causes zero live writes.
- The report is one projection consumed by both renderers. Alongside the sorted
  items it carries the observed host mode, the authority rows the run
  exercised -- including the start, import, and delete refusals that are the
  evidence nothing was activated or adopted -- and the post-execute
  reobservation.
- A Registry commit failure performs no tmux mutation. A partial tmux failure
  leaves the durable Registry identity in place, replans current drift, and
  reports completed stages, remaining items, and the exact retry command.
  Repeating after success plans no writes and does not replace `registry.json`.
- `--socket` is exact `-L`; absolute `--socket-path` and inherited `$TMUX` are
  exact `-S`. No-flag use outside tmux is rejected before planning. No default
  socket, fallback server, config reload, state-loss recovery, or heuristic UID
  merge exists on this route.
- Public repair is stricter than lifecycle compatibility convergence for
  foreign state. An unknown, duplicate, or wrong-owner live UID makes its
  session diagnostic-only so later ordinal rows cannot slide onto a different
  Registry object. Safe drift elsewhere may converge; the refused item remains
  explicit and nonzero. `get`, `describe`, and `doctor` never enter this path.
- A known, unique `@projmux_project_uid` is the authority for Project rebind
  drift: the old non-empty `@projmux_project_path` does not turn that session
  foreign. The planner emits only the path-option repair, guards it with the
  unchanged Project UID, and becomes a no-op after convergence. Unknown or
  duplicate Project UID claims remain refused.

Explicit Registry topology materialization:

- `reconcile resources --materialize-project <name|uid:uid>` selects exactly
  one Registry Project and uses a separate pure plan. The default reconciliation
  shadow never calls the materializer, and the materialization plan never runs
  blank adoption, orphan minting, or Agent phase observation. Registry insertion
  order determines session/Window/Window-owned shell Pane/Agent creation order;
  report keys provide a separately stable rendering order. Agents are created
  last inside their Window. A shell or managed-Agent `anchorPaneRef` must be
  proven on the exact Window; no alternate live Pane is inferred.
- Registry presence is desired topology. Missing runtime sessions, Windows,
  Window-owned `role=shell` Panes, and Agents are drift; canonical Registry
  deletion removes that desire. Exact uid/name/owner mirrors are retained. Stored
  Pane CWD drives only that Pane's detached runtime cwd, while Project root
  remains the session path anchor and `PROJMUX_CWD` hook value.
  `Pane.spec.command`, snapshot recipes, notifications, and ephemeral sessions
  are never execution inputs.
- An Agent whose managed Pane is not live is replayed into a new managed Pane on
  its Window's proven anchor, through the same allocation, activation ledger,
  ownership-checked adoption, and rollback the shell half uses. The **only**
  replay identifier is Registry `status.sessionRef`: no provider conversation
  store is read, `ClaudeSessionRef.TranscriptPath` in particular is never
  consulted, and snapshot recipe `resumeID` is a separate value that never feeds
  this path. The launch argv comes from the two seams `create agent` already
  owns -- `PlanAgentResume` for a ref that names a conversation, `PlanAgentLaunch`
  with no payload otherwise -- so the topology engine holds no launch builder of
  its own and the Settings enabled-agents gate still applies. An Agent that
  cannot rejoin its conversation comes back on a *new* one and the reason is
  disclosed; an Agent that cannot be launched at all is disclosed and skipped.
  Neither aborts the materialization, and neither is ever silent. A stale managed
  Pane row is released only after the server-wide uid preflight proves its uid is
  live nowhere on the exact socket.
- An offline Agent-only Window plans a visible `allocate default shell` Registry
  item, authors that direct shell under the same convergent transaction, creates
  the Window from it, and then replays the anchor Agent while preserving the
  Agent Pane uid. The default shell is bootstrap, not a replacement anchor. A
  successful repeat is a Registry-write-free and topology-write-free no-op.
- Snapshot restore is a target-Project subtree projection, never a Registry
  restore. Metadata-bearing v1 snapshots preserve surviving final-v2
  anchor/default refs; metadata-free snapshots choose the first Window-local
  Pane as anchor and the first direct shell as optional default. Agent-only
  desired Windows remain Agent-anchored and acquire a shell only through the
  ordinary materializer. Source snapshot bytes and unrelated roots are never
  rewritten, and a second projection is byte-stable.
- `Recreate Project` replaces the exact same-root Project graph, after an
  explicit confirmation, in one Registry
  commit. It always allocates a new Project UID plus one new canonical Window
  and direct shell UID, whether the old Project retained Windows or had zero.
  The preimage remains the durable recovery state when the replacement commit
  fails, and successful validation requires exactly one same-root claimant.
- Exact-socket reconciliation merges scoped results by UID at their existing
  global Registry positions. Positive mirrored evidence may change only the
  selected socket's owned rows; sibling sockets and other-host-only desired
  refs/status retain both values and byte order. Absence on the selected host
  is never re-anchor, status-clear, or delete authority.
- Preflight rejects a missing/invalid root or Pane CWD, a zero-Window Project,
  an anchor ref that is neither an exact same-Window shell nor the owning
  Agent's current managed Pane, a live Window whose exact anchor is dead, and foreign,
  duplicate, wrong-owner, or ambiguous live claims before the first create.
  Execute rechecks the same plan under the Registry lock. A server-wide uid
  preflight runs first, *before* the selected Project session is created,
  because creating it runs the public pre/post-create hooks whose side effects no
  rollback can undo; a missing server is read as an empty inventory. The
  inventory is then refreshed once the session exists, so the new tuple is
  covered and any race since the preflight is caught. Together, and before the
  first Window or Pane mutation, they prove that every planned live Window is
  owned by the selected Session, every planned live Pane is owned by its planned
  Window, and every planned Window/Pane uid is live on exactly the expected
  handle or nowhere at all. UID equality alone is insufficient: a
  relinked Window or a join-paned Pane keeps its uid, and a Window relinked out
  of the selected Session is invisible to a selected-Session plan. Each created
  Pane proves its own parent before its uid claim. It records only objects it
  creates -- including one that tmux mutated before reporting a synchronous
  hook failure -- and rolls those objects back in reverse order only while their
  exact uid mirror still proves ownership. External hook effects are outside
  that rollback guarantee. A successful repeat performs no session ensure,
  lease write, tmux create, Registry replace, or mirror write.
- Exact `--socket/-L` supports offline full materialization with the existing
  pre/post-create hook contract. Exact `--socket-path/-S` supports live partial
  Window/Pane repair. Offline session creation through arbitrary `-S` is a
  stable safety refusal: the public hook contract exposes name-only
  `PROJMUX_SOCKET`, so an absolute path cannot be represented without either
  silently routing hook re-entry to another server or changing that public
  contract. A future versioned hook socket-path contract can lift the refusal.
  Only the selected exact socket is claimed and mutated; sibling sockets are
  tested unchanged, and no global uniqueness across unknown sockets is claimed.

Plan-only runtime mutation boundary:

- Lifecycle and topology changes owned by the app materializer and Pane-delete
  runtime are values before they are commands. The closed action inventory
  records a stable target, a typed guard with the exact expected evidence, a
  total order, expected effect, and typed executable operands; its JSON
  projection is deterministic. The argv seam rejects an operand target that
  does not match the printable stable target.
  Session/Window/Pane creation, identity and create-operation lease writes,
  layout writes, ownership-checked rollback, exact Pane kill, pre-commit
  tombstone/restore, and post-result-flush self-kill queueing all enter the same
  plan -> printable target/route guard -> effect reobserve/replan -> semantic
  guard -> execute -> effect reobserve/replan boundary. Before an already
  satisfied row may disappear, the executor binds its printed logical/physical
  socket and server-generation authority to the captured route; semantic
  pre-write guards still run together before the first live write.
- Materialization is a sequence of dynamically replanned stages because exact
  Window and Pane handles do not exist until the preceding create effect is
  reobserved. Each stage is nevertheless a complete printable plan with a
  total order; the next stage is built only from the preceding stage's observed
  exact effect. Every production row carries `-L=<name>` or the exact
  `-S=<absolute path>`, the independently observed physical socket, and a
  printable route receipt. App-owned receipts pin `#{pid}` plus ownership and
  logical markers; inherited standalone receipts pin the exact server pid and
  originating `$N`/`@N`/`%N` containment while requiring both app markers
  blank. The public controller's explicit `--socket-path` grant is narrower:
  it prints the operator-selected path/PID blank-marker class and relies on
  each planned action's real UID plus session/window guards; it never infers an
  arbitrary Pane as invocation evidence. Generated popup/menu producers pass an exact Pane anchor which is
  reobserved on that same socket rather than trusting a targetless current
  Pane. Before a stage writes, the same `-S` runner refuses path, generation,
  class, or containment drift. Only a create-session
  stage may accept the typed no-server observation, because its explicit route
  and absent-session ownership preflight are the facts required to create the
  first server.
- A guard refusal writes nothing and asks the caller to observe and plan again.
  Reobservation is explicit: known achieved effects remove their rows, so a
  successful repeat is an empty plan; an unavailable observation is unknown and
  can neither synthesize a Registry deletion nor authorize a runtime kill.
  Partial execution rolls back only actions carrying an ownership-backed undo,
  in reverse application order. Existing desired Registry state, foreign or
  sibling objects, and other sockets have no rollback authority.
- Pane deletion keeps the exact routed socket plus Session, Window, Pane, root
  kind/root uid, and current Pane mirror in every executable guard. A
  caller-containing delete still commits the Registry and flushes the complete
  result before its self-target kill is queued. The AI picker/default/resume and
  shell split producers remain canonical create-intent producers; they do not
  gain a second tmux mutation path.

Agent runtime linkage:

- Once a live tmux pane has settled on a registry Pane, reconcile decides which
  **Agent** that Pane is the managed Pane of. Without this step the registry had
  running agents with no Agent resource and Agent resources with no
  `status.paneRef`, so `get panes` printed an empty AGENT column for every row
  and `get agents` listed finished conversations while hiding running ones.
- **The evidence is authorship, not a command name.** `pane_current_command ==
  claude` says a process called claude is running; it is equally true of a pane
  the operator typed `claude` into by hand, and nothing here reads it. The
  evidence is `@projmux_ai_agent`, the pane option the AI routes write when
  *projmux itself* launches an agent into a pane. A pane without it gets no
  Agent — Phase 1's refuse rule, unchanged. The legacy import path already
  trusted exactly this option to mint an Agent on its create path; linkage makes
  the adopt and rebind paths agree with it.
- **The canonical default shell remains Registry-owned.** A generic
  `@projmux_ai_agent` marker on the direct Window-owned `role=shell` Pane named
  by `Window.spec.defaultShellPaneRef` is reported as reason-bearing D2 and
  performs no Agent mint, Pane reparent, or reservation move. Runtime metadata
  cannot invalidate the Registry's canonical shell chain. This exception is
  deliberately exact: an anchor-only shell that is not the default shell keeps
  the existing linkage behavior, whose promotion semantics belong to the
  separate anchor/primary-shell track.
- **Which Agent, in order.** (1) The Pane is already Agent-owned: that Agent is
  the answer and only `status.paneRef` is repaired. (2) An Agent in the same
  Window already records the same provider conversation in `status.sessionRef`
  as the pane carries in `@projmux_ai_session_id` / `@projmux_ai_thread_id` —
  an exact identifier equality on a value both sides got from the provider, with
  `provider` compared too so a Codex thread id is never equated with a Claude
  session id. (3) Otherwise a new Agent is minted, named through the registry's
  own allocator over the provider name base, with the observed topic going to the
  non-identifying `projmux.io/agent-topic` annotation.
- **Ambiguity mints rather than guesses.** Two Agents recording one conversation
  is legal registry state, so an ambiguous conversation match cannot be resolved
  to "the first one"; taking a binding that might belong to the other Agent is
  the mistake no later pass can undo, while an extra Agent is inert and visible.
  A candidate already claimed by this pass, or one whose `paneRef` is some other
  Pane, is not a candidate at all — one Agent is the runtime owner of at most one
  live pane. The candidate set is the paired Window's Agents and nothing else, so
  the Project boundary is structural here too.
- **A linked Pane is promoted, and that is the one rewrite of an existing
  resource.** Its `spec.role` becomes `agent` and its `ownerRef` moves from the
  Window to the Agent, with its name reservation following it into the Agent's
  scope. The uid does not change, the name does not change, and the Project and
  Window it sits under do not change — the Agent is owned by the very Window that
  owned the Pane. `ownerRef` is the single edge every other reader resolves
  Agent↔Pane through (the AGENT column, hook session-ref attribution, cascading
  delete), so expressing the link only in `status.paneRef` would create a second,
  disagreeing source of truth.
- `status.sessionRef` is **not** written here. The pane option is a live routing
  index and the durable conversation pointer belongs to hook ingest, which
  reaches the Agent on its own once the Pane is Agent-owned.
- **A promoted Pane joins the managed-Pane lifecycle**, which is a visible
  consequence: the dead-agent-pane sweep releases an Agent whose managed Pane
  died and removes that Pane row, where a Window-owned shell Pane was never in
  its reach. That is the existing managed-Pane contract applying to panes that
  genuinely are managed. The **Agent** is preserved either way — same uid, same
  name, same `sessionRef`, still resumable.
- Linkage is idempotent: the next pass finds the Pane already Agent-owned and
  reasserts nothing, so a reconciler that runs on every mutation route converges
  instead of accumulating Agents. It is tolerant like the writes around it — a
  link that cannot be made writes nothing, does not cost the pane the binding
  that already succeeded, and does not fail the operator's command.
- Reapply stays a **mutation-route** concern, like the rest of reconcile. Read
  verbs still `LoadReadOnly` and still never materialize the registry. A tmux
  server that is absent or erroring still fails closed with no error, and a
  binding write or an orphan registration that fails is skipped rather than
  escalated — the next pass sees the same drift and tries again. It is
  maintenance riding along inside somebody else's transaction: one pane it cannot
  register must not fail the `create` that happened to trigger it.

Resource-first create:

- **One parser, one product model.** `create window|pane|agent|<provider>` share
  a single argv surface and a single resource-backed implementation.
  `--project` is a scope flag, never a mode selector, so no flag chooses between
  two meanings of the same command. The runtime-only "split the current window"
  half that used to sit behind an absent `--project` is removed; a raw,
  unmanaged split is tmux's own verb, not a projmux resource verb.
- **Scope resolution has exactly two branches.** An explicit `--project`/`-p`
  wins inside and outside tmux and suppresses the active-target read entirely.
  With no `--project`, the Project is derived from the active exact runtime
  through the same `@projmux_window_uid` mirror and registry `ownerRef` chain
  the read verbs use.
- **Window and anchor follow the whole scope, not the Project flag.** They are
  derived only when the argv named no `--project`, `--window`, `--pane`,
  `--selector`, `--all-windows`, and no `--primary-window` at all. That keeps a
  bare `create pane --placement right` -- the generated keybinding body -- a
  split of the Window the operator is looking at, rather than of the Project's
  primary Window, which is what the same route resolves once a `--project` scope
  is typed, while one explicit occurrence still fixes the whole target set. An explicit `--pane` or popup
  origin is the exact split anchor. Only a scope with no Pane consumes the
  target Window's role-agnostic `spec.anchorPaneRef`; a missing, stale, dead, or
  cross-Window ref refuses with no alternate-live-Pane inference.
- **Refusals cost nothing.** Home, control, unattributed, foreign, a mirrored
  uid the Registry does not hold, a Window whose Project is gone, and every
  outside-tmux invocation with no `--project` are usage errors naming
  `--project`. They are raised before the registry transaction opens, so they
  are measurably zero Registry writes and zero tmux calls. Nothing falls back to
  a runtime-only split, nothing invents a Project from `$HOME`, a session name,
  or a cwd, and no default server is probed.
- **Host neutrality is transport-level, not policy-level.** Inside an app-owned
  or a standalone server the create mutates only the inherited exact socket,
  because every tmux call it issues inherits `$TMUX` and it never enumerates
  siblings. Outside tmux an explicit Project is the gate before anything live is
  touched.
- **Everything is detached.** No create path issues `switch-client`,
  `select-window`, `select-pane`, or `attach-session`. `focus pane` and
  `-o pane-id` are how a caller ends up in the new pane.
- **Focus is navigation-only.** `focus project|window|pane` reads live tmux
  inventory and may move an existing client, but has no Registry store and
  issues no session/Window/Pane creation, identity-marker, rename, respawn, or
  deletion write. An offline target remains offline and exits unresolved.

Selector and the implicit active target:

- A selector value is either `uid:<uid>` or a `metadata.name`. There is no
  bare-uid form; ephemeral context, `spec.root`, and tmux `%N`/`@N`/`$N` handles are
  structurally unmatchable. `--project` is at-most-once and fixes the scope,
  `--window`/`--pane` repeat and union, `--selector key=value` repeats and ANDs,
  and how many targets a `<verb, kind>` pair accepts comes from one declared
  cardinality matrix rather than per-route rules.
- Inside tmux, an invocation of a **singular read or rename verb** that carries
  no selector at all resolves the **active tmux target**: `get pane`,
  `describe project|window|pane|agent`, `rename project|window|pane`, and
  `rebind project`. Any reference, scope flag, or label keeps picking the target
  itself; the destructive routes are unaffected. `create` reads the same seam
  under its own rule, described below.
- The plural registry reads `get windows|panes|agents` use the active Window's
  exact Registry owner as their default managed root. A Project-owned Window
  exposes only that Project's descendants; a ControlSession-owned Window (the
  Home control surface) exposes only that ControlSession's descendants. Name
  and label selectors continue to filter inside that default root. An explicit
  `uid:` selector is already opaque Registry-global authority, so it bypasses
  active-root observation and narrowing, including from a foreign tmux Pane.
  An in-tmux Window with no exact existing Project or ControlSession owner is a
  usage refusal with zero stdout only when no explicit Project, whole-set, or
  uid authority bypasses the default; it never silently falls back.
- An **explicit singular reference** on `describe window|pane|agent` remains
  Project-namespaced. Generic `rename window|pane|agent` instead derives the
  exact Project or ControlSession that owns the active Window. When
  `--project` is absent inside a managed Project, both families derive the
  Project from the active Window uid mirror and Registry owner chain. This
  narrows the Window universe only; it never
  chooses one Window, Pane, or Agent for the operator, so a same-named pair
  inside the one Project stays the ordinary bounded exact-one ambiguity and a
  `uid:` reference outside the scope is a no-match rather than a cross-Project
  hit. The describe family remains the intentional Project-only difference;
  Phase 14 extends only the generic rename family to ControlSession.
  `get projects`, `describe|rename project`, `delete`, `rebind`, and `agent
  resume` are outside that reference scope, and notifications and snapshots
  belong to separate stores. Delete's exact live preflight nevertheless follows
  either root kind through the selected descendant's owner chain.
- `--all-projects` is the explicit registry-wide escape for those three reads.
  It is deliberately different from destructive `delete --all`, whose existing
  whole-registry compatibility meaning is unchanged. A bare `--all` is not a
  read flag. Explicit `--project` keeps its prior result and cannot be combined
  with `--all-projects`.
- Outside tmux, an omitted root scope keeps the historical whole-registry
  inventory and its ambiguity, for a plural read and for a reference alike.
  Inside tmux, a missing Window binding or broken managed-root owner chain is a
  usage refusal with zero stdout, never a silent global fallback. The selector
  engine's `windowScope` is the single choice point for explicit Project,
  active-derived Project/ControlSession root, or global scope, shared by Window,
  Pane, and Agent resolution. The plural default and the Project-only singular
  namespace both fill `Query.DefaultRoot`; only the former can carry a
  ControlSession kind. The default is consulted only after ruling out explicit
  `--project`, `--all-projects`/`-A`, and any applicable `uid:` occurrence.
- There is **no sentinel value token**. `current` and `active` pass
  `ValidateName`, so `--pane current` would shadow a resource that legitimately
  carries that name. Omission is the only spelling. If an explicit one is ever
  needed, `.` (reserved by `ValidateName`) and `@` (a forbidden name rune) are
  the two collision-free candidates; neither is claimed today.
- Being inside tmux is decided from `$TMUX_PANE` plus `$TMUX`, and that pane id
  is passed as an explicit `-t` target. It is deliberately **not** decided by
  whether a tmux command succeeds: a bare `display-message -p` from outside a
  client still answers, for the most-recently-used session, which would silently
  select a wrong target.
- Only two options are read: `@projmux_pane_uid` on the active pane and
  `@projmux_window_uid` on its window (window-scoped options resolve through a
  pane target). Every ancestor above them comes from `ownerRef` — the Project or
  ControlSession is the owner of the active Window, and the Agent is the owner
  of the active Pane.
  The session-scoped `@projmux_project_uid` is **not** consulted: it is
  measurably empty on live sessions, so trusting it would refuse targets the
  owner chain resolves.
- There is no persistent, queryable scope and no `set-context` equivalent. The
  observation is re-read on every invocation, which costs one `display-message`
  and leaves nothing to go stale. `describe pane` with no selector is itself the
  preview of what the singular family will act on; the plural-read Project
  default consumes the same observation and owner chain without choosing an
  individual resource.
- An active target that maps onto no registry resource is a **refusal**, not a
  fallthrough: exit `2`, zero stdout, no resource selected, nothing written, and
  a message naming what was inspected. It is deliberately not the
  `matched N ..., want exactly one` cardinality error, because an unmanaged pane
  carrying no `@projmux_pane_uid` is the common case and presenting it as
  ambiguity would hide the cause. An undecidable *namespace* refuses with its
  own message rather than that one, because "no selector was given" is false on
  an invocation that carried a reference and would send the operator after the
  wrong cause.

## Naming metadata model

Projmux keeps visible naming separate from source metadata:

- **User pane label** is persistent pane-scoped metadata stored in
  `@projmux_pane_label`. The Rename Pane action sets or clears only this field;
  it does not write the AI topic or raw pane title.
- **Pane border label** is the primary visible pane name. In the app tmux
  config and native previews it resolves to user pane label first, agent AI
  topic second, known interactive shell command (`zsh`, `bash`, `fish`, `sh`,
  `nu`, `xonsh`) third, and raw pane title last.
- **Window tab name** follows the active pane's visible pane label through the
  same tmux format expression used by the pane border. Historically the app
  config used raw `#{pane_title}` for `automatic-rename-format`, which let shell
  OSC titles such as branch names diverge from the pane border; generated app
  config now keeps the two aligned.
- **Terminal / pane title** remains raw title metadata owned by the running app
  or shell. It is still available to tmux and to Projmux features that need
  title evidence, but it is not the canonical Projmux window naming source.
- **AI topic** is agent-owned naming metadata stored in `@projmux_ai_topic`.
  Its set/clear CLI and watcher manual-ownership behavior remain independent of
  user pane labels.
- **Git branch** belongs in the statusbar git segment. Branch-based terminal
  title overwrites are not promoted to the primary Projmux pane or window name.
- **Session snapshots** store source metadata separately: `window_name`, raw
  `pane_title`, user `label`, `@projmux_ai_topic`, manual topic ownership, and
  agent resume metadata. Old snapshots decode with an absent label and absent
  ownership; title/topic equality never infers either. Replay writes each
  semantic field to the exact pane id returned by tmux creation and restores
  raw title from `Pane.Title` after launch/startup replay. Snapshots do not
  store a resolved `display_label`; visible labels are recomputed by display
  policy.

## Notify queue

`projmux` keeps a single JSON-backed queue of pending notifications at
`<state>/projmux/notify.json` (typically `~/.local/state/projmux/notify.json`,
following XDG). Writes go through an `O_CREATE|O_EXCL` lock file
(`notify.json.lock`) with bounded retry + jittered backoff so the queue
is safe across concurrent producers (the AI flow, the manual `attention
toggle`, the `create notification` CLI) on a local filesystem.

Attention and notify are intentionally separate surfaces: attention is live
tmux pane state, while notify is the explicit-ack pending queue derived from
AI reply panes and explicit pushes. The queue helps clicks route to work; it
does not own the truth of every live badge.

- **Push** — `projmux create notification` (or the in-process producer in
  `internal/app/notify_producer.go`) appends an entry. Entries carry a
  stable id (caller-supplied or `ai:<session>:<pane>` for the producer
  path), text (capped at 80 runes), severity (`info|warn|critical`),
  source (`ai|k8s|git|external`), TTL freshness metadata (default 600s), and a
  `Target{Socket, Session, Window, Pane}`. Re-pushing an existing id
  refreshes the entry's text and timestamp.
- **List** — `projmux get notifications` returns newest-first without mutating the
  queue. TTL alone is not a removal condition. `projmux get notifications --live` adds a
  read-only comparison against live pane state, explaining manual reply
  badges without queue entries, live AI replies with/missing queue entries,
  and inactive (`queue-stale`) `ai:` entries.
- **Ack** — `projmux notification ack <id>` removes one entry; `--all`
  flushes everything. Interactive focus/click handlers ack after successful
  focus, and gone/unroutable targets clean up without focusing.
- **Reconcile** — `projmux notification reconcile` walks
  `tmux list-panes -a` and back-fills entries for panes whose
  attention state is `reply` AND whose AI agent option is set,
  reporting inactive `ai:` entries that no longer match a live reply+agent pane without
  acking them. It then removes rows only when they are both TTL-expired and
  gone from the real pane/session inventory, and enforces a 256-row hard cap
  by evicting oldest overflow. Live rows otherwise remain explicit-ack-only.
  `make install` and `projmux update apply` invoke it so the queue
  recovers from any drift introduced by a lost daemon.

The producer is wired to the attention state machine: a pane
transitioning to `reply` with an AI agent option set pushes an
`ai:<session>:<pane>` entry; the matching `clear` (or the AI
flow's `status set idle`) leaves it pending until explicit ack. Manual `attention toggle` on a
shell pane does not push because the agent option is empty —
the queue is intentionally AI-driven only.

See [notify-queue.md](notify-queue.md) for the full reference.

## Usage snapshots

`projmux agent usage` and `projmux internal status usage` share a single `Manager`
that walks two registered adapters (Claude, Codex) and persists the
result to `<state>/projmux/usage/snapshots.json` (or
`PROJMUX_USAGE_STATE_DIR`). The cache file is the authoritative source
for the HUD render path so the tmux status interval never blocks on a
network call.

- **Per-adapter throttle** — Claude reports a 5-minute hint via the
  `ThrottleHinter` interface; Codex falls through to the global
  `30s` floor used by `internal status usage`. `MaybeCollect` only invokes an
  adapter when `now - last_collect >= throttle`. `--force` bypasses the
  gate.
- **429 backoff** — Claude implements `BackoffStater`. On HTTP 429
  the adapter persists `BackoffState{Until, Consecutive}`: the
  default cooldown is 30 minutes, doubling per consecutive 429 up to a
  60-minute cap. A `Retry-After` header (when present) raises the floor.
  During backoff `Collect` short-circuits (no network call). A clean
  200 resets the streak. `--force` clears the persisted state via the
  `BackoffResetter` interface so the next call attempts the network
  call regardless of streak.
- **Failure preservation** — adapter failures do not erase prior
  rows. The Manager merges new snapshots over the on-disk slice, so a
  transient 429 keeps the last known good numbers visible.
- **Codex native source selection** — the Codex adapter alone owns one
  invocation's source decision. It normalizes native
  `account/rateLimits/read` plus bounded sparse update events into snapshots;
  only unavailable/unsupported/account-empty outcomes invoke the newest
  rollout parser once. Native and rollout rows are never synthesized together.
  Optional snapshot provenance preserves source, fallback/stale reason, and
  native bucket label/cadence through Store and all public read surfaces.

See [usage-tracking.md](usage-tracking.md) for adapter detail (token
refresh, rollout schema).

## Two-line clickable status bar

projmux configures tmux with `status 2`. Line 0 is the existing
session/window/path/git/clock row. Line 1 splits the notification bar
(left half, capped at 80 cells) and the AI usage HUD (right half, capped at
120 cells) using tmux `#[align=left]` / `#[align=right]`. Each clickable
segment is wrapped in a tmux user-defined range (`#[range=user|<id>]...
#[norange]`) and dispatched through `projmux internal statusbar click <range-id>`. A
single `bind -n MouseDown1Status` covers both lines because tmux fires
`MouseDown1Status` from any line of a multi-line status bar with
`#{mouse_status_range}` resolving to whichever range the cursor was over.

| Range id | Line | Click action                              | Keybinding   |
|----------|------|-------------------------------------------|--------------|
| session  | 0    | popup `projmux runtime sessions --ui=popup` | prefix+s s |
| pwd      | 0    | show pane_current_path in a display-only path popup | prefix+s p   |
| git      | 0    | popup `projmux switch --ui=popup`         | prefix+s g   |
| usage    | 1    | popup `projmux agent usage`               | prefix+s u   |
| notify   | 1    | focus origin pane of newest notification  | prefix+s n   |

The keyboard chord uses `bind-key s switch-client -T projmux-status` so the
prefix-then-`s`-then-letter shortcut routes through the same dispatcher as
the mouse click. Empty `#{mouse_status_range}` (clicks on whitespace) is a
no-op so the binding never flashes a spurious error.
The hardcoded `prefix s r` sibling is usage-specific: it runs the existing
throttled collector and then reopens the same display-only usage popup from
cache.

## Related design and inventory notes

### Plan-only managed runtime mutation

Managed lifecycle/topology changes are printable `runtimeMutationPlan` rows.
Each row carries an exact invocation route, immutable observed socket path,
printable server-generation authority, a stable tmux handle and Registry
UID/owner chain, a closed guard, total order,
expected effect, and printable typed operands bound to that handle. Execution
validates printable target/route authority before pre-effect reobservation and
every pending semantic guard before the first write;
owned rollback runs in reverse order. Materialization is intentionally staged:
after each dynamic handle is returned, it is reobserved and the next stage is
planned, so no later action guesses a Window or Pane handle. A successful
reobserve/replan is empty; an unknown observation authorizes no delete or kill.
App-owned execution requires exact path/pid/app/logical evidence. An inherited
standalone route is separately closed by exact `TMUX=path,pid,index` plus a
producer-verified Pane receipt and prints/executes through `-S`; partial app
markers never downgrade to standalone. Explicit controller reconciliation may
instead use an operator-selected `--socket-path` plus PID/blank-marker receipt,
but only action-specific UID and containment guards authorize its writes.
Fresh app bootstrap is the only
pre-server declaration without a generation receipt, and binds path/pid/$@%
before its route marker and all later rows.

The maintained product table in `internal/app/runtime_mutation_surface.go` maps
generated catalog/menu producers, native provider/resume picker selections,
sidebar/session-picker stops, and app lifecycle entrypoints in both directions
to their handler and plan verb. It also records exact semantic exemptions for
focus, labels, operator-requested layout, mouse forwarding, snapshot replay,
ephemeral maintenance, app quit, and human runtime maintenance. Managed argv
verbs are selected only by the typed executor seam; generated Window
create/rename, Pane-menu create/delete, and automatic post-split layout writes
reach typed intent/operand routes rather than embedding tmux lifecycle commands.
