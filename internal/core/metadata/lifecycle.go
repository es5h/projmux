// The lifecycle projection: turning one piece of termination evidence and one
// observed runtime absence into durable Agent and Pane state.
//
// Everything in this file is a *consumer*. Nothing here mints a generation,
// launches a process, kills a runtime object, or decides that anything should be
// started; the whole file runs against a registry and a set of pane uids that a
// caller has already observed to be absent on one exact host. That is the
// property the phase boundary rests on: an observation is not an activation
// authority, so a pass that reconciles a hundred dead panes still starts
// nothing.
//
// The classifications are not collapsed into phases and then forgotten. The
// phase answers "is this Agent resumable", but the reason an operator needs in
// order to act distinguishes a delete, Project-stop interruption, clean exit,
// external kill, crash, and unexplained disappearance. Both are stored: the
// phase on status.phase, the evidence on status.lastTermination, and a distinct
// status.reason clause tying them together.

// Termination reason clauses. Each classification gets its own, because
// status.reason is the one line an operator reads next to the phase, and two
// classifications sharing a clause would make the phase the only thing
// separating them -- which is exactly the information the phase collapses.

// ProjectTermination is the one lifecycle transition of the exit reconciler.

// It consumes the receipt the Pane already stores, or records an unknown one
// when it stores none, and applies the single transition that evidence implies:
//
//   - a shell Pane keeps its logical existence and gains the evidence. A runtime
//     object going away is not a statement about desired topology, and deleting
//     the resource here would make a crashed shell indistinguishable from one
//     the operator asked to remove.
//   - an Agent's *current* managed Pane is unbound by status only: the Agent
//     moves to the phase the evidence implies, drops status.paneRef, and keeps
//     both status.sessionRef and the Pane row. Runtime observation is evidence
//     of disappearance, not canonical delete authority.
//   - the one exception is a managed Pane its Window anchors. status.paneRef is
//     what makes an Agent-role anchorPaneRef valid, so dropping it there would
//     leave the Window anchored on a Pane no Agent claims and the Registry would
//     stop validating. The binding is kept, the phase alone reports that nothing
//     runs in it, and the result is the offline Agent-anchored Window snapshot
//     restore already projects and the materializer already knows how to replay.
//   - an Agent-owned Pane the Agent no longer binds is evidence only. The Agent
//     has since been relaunched onto another Pane, and touching it here would
//     apply a dead process's exit to a live one.
//
// It is idempotent by construction. The unknown receipt it writes is the thing
// that makes it so: a second pass over the same disappearance finds that
// document already stored, RecordTermination reports it a duplicate, and nothing
// is written. An absence with no stored value would be re-projected forever.
//
// It performs no runtime call of any kind and can start nothing.
